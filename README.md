This is my notes for Blue Prince!🙂 Check out my live playthrough on twitch at https://www.twitch.tv/slidedrum! Here is everything I know about the game so far.  As of the initial release of this, I am just starting act 3 after solving the Map puzzle in Room 46.

I hope you find this interesting!  And I look forward to looking back at this repo after I finish the game.

# How to use
This is intended for use with https://obsidian.md/.  A free note taking application. Just download this repo as a zip, unzip it, and open it as a obsidian vault!  

You can view a (slightly buggy) web based version of this vault at https://my.flowershow.app/@slidedrum/Blue-Prince-Notes/

Of course you could also just view it inside of GitHub directly, but then you won't get the fancy image imbeds and really nice links.

# Caveats
To make this fit on Github I had to compress all images to 720p, so they may not be as readable as they are for me.  On my system they are all 4k screenshots and the folder is 6gb, too large for Github. 🙁
