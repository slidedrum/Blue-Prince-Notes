After coring the words, I get these numbers

| 19  | 20  | 9   | 12  | 12  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 23  | 1   | 20  | 5   | 18  |

| 2   | 12  | 1   | 14  | 11  |
| 2   | 15  | 15  | 11  | 19  |
After converting them back into letters I get

| S   | T   | I   | L   | L   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| W   | A   | T   | E   | R   |

This is telling me to take the [[The Original Gardener's Logbook#^f45d6d|still]] water from [[The Trading Post]], put it in the [[Watering Can]] and take it to the blank books in [[The Library]].  Once I do some new text is revealed.

	- My dearest darling [[Simon H. Sinclair|son]] I am quite impressed. l didn't expect you to make it this far, yet if these words have reached your eyes, rest assured, the end of ==the spiral== is near! Stay vigilant and ==rosewary==, for the thorns we discover are ==twice as sharp== at the conclusion of ==each of our journeys==.  
	- One final counsel I leave you: The waters of the ==**west spring**== shall yet reveal more ==**secrets**== than these mere ==**passages**==.  
	- I had so many ==plans== but not enough ==dreams==, 
	- [[Simon H. Sinclair|Your]] mother [[Baroness Auravei|Auravei]]
	- Pictured: [[The Spiral Of Stars]]
	- I think this is telling me to use a secret passage to green room in [[Outer Room]] using blessing of the monk from [[The Shrine]]

	- A hidden hue
	- From prism pristine, three paths convene.
		- [[Prism Key]]
		- [[Drafting]] 3 rooms
	- Three lines of light.  Three shades foreseen.
	- Three colors to count, a sum of eighteen.
		- room numbers add to 18
	- But the one left hidden, remains to be seen.
