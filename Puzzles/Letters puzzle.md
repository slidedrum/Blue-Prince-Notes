- In [[The Precipice#^d20cff]] behind the [[Weak Wall]] identified in [[The Safehouse - Royal Station]] there are some [[The Precipice#^f2ef48|letters]]
- This initially just says "Castle" this is a hint for part of [[Chess Pieces]]
- I have seen this type of letters in several places:
	- [[Tomb Statue Puzzle|statue]] in [[The Cloister#^d10b76]]
		-  ![[Pasted image 20251215231039.png]]
	- The [[The Kennel#^9b7d9c|cat picture]] in [[The Kennel]]
		- ![[Pasted image 20251210093356.png]]
	- Part of [[A New Clue#^23d56c]]?
		- ![[Pasted image 20251210104905.png]]
	- [[The Black Bridge Grotto#^291607]]?
		- ![[Pasted image 20251210033925.png]]
	- One of the lockers in [[The Locker Room#^8c24f3]]
		- ![[Pasted image 20251222121821.png]]
	- One of the [[Vault Keys|deposit boxes]] in [[The Vault]]?
		- ![[Pasted image 20251210084228.png]]
- They read:

| C   | I   | X   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A   | D   | D   |
| S   | I   | X   |
| T   | O   | R   |
| L   | O   | R   |
| E   | T   | T   |
	- CIX (109)
	- ADD
	- SIX (115)
	- TOR (counter clockwise?)
	- LOR (word)
	- ETT (east in [[Erajan]])
- This is the solution to the [[Unknown tomb]] clock puzzle
- ![[Pasted image 20251219122346.png]]
- This matches the squares on the side of the clock in the [[Unknown tomb]]
