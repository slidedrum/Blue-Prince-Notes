#Chess-Pieces #no-leads #puzzle #Puzzle/solved 
I see chess pieces fucking everywhere!

- There is a chessboard in [[The Precipice#^333854|The Precipice]]
- It lights up when you put the corresponding peace in the corresponding place that matches with your house.
	- Even if the color of the peace does not match.
- Once you place ever piece on the board, you can pick one of the pieces and select their power.
	- Pawn: once you reach rank 8, you can select any other power except king for that day.
	- Rook: When drafting in to any corner room, you get 4 re-rolls.
	- Knight: Add [[The Armory]] to today's draft pool.
	- Bishop: Instead of paying 1 [[coins]] when you enter [[The Chapel]], gain 30 [[coins]].
	- Queen: Each time you draft a room on the Queenside (West Wing) of your house, lose 5 Steps and gain 1 Key. (on entry)
	- King: Pick one room color to make more common for today's draft pool.

- King:

	- [x] [[The Throne room]] #black-king\

- If you have the rook power, and then switch to the king power a new door opens
	- Presumably this is also possible if you have king and switch to rook.  
	- This is what the castling hints were pointing to.
