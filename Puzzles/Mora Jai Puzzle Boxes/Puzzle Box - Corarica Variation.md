	 - Far from the port towns of the lesser islands, the academies of Corarica were among the last strongholds where the puzzle box fad spread. Unlike other realms, whose regional rule variations emerged organically over time, the students of Corarica designed ORANGE TILES by committee, voting on student-submitted designs and picking the one they felt best represented the realm.  
	 - When these tiles are pressed, if the majority of adjacent tiles share a color, then the pressed tile will change to that color.
