- The [[Eraja]] Variation
- The puzzle boxes of [[Mora Jai]] spread to [[Eraja]] not through port towns, as they had in other realms, but by train routes from the north. When VIOLET TILES were introduced, they were created as a simple reflection of the variation first introduced by [[Arch Aries]] some years earlier.  
- When VIOLET TILES are pressed, they move South.
