- Inside [[Room 46]] there is a map on the wall, with 8 pins.  It says "8 realms in 8 months"
	- Originally i assumed this was the order they were conquered in, but that's not correct. it's his trip!
- I need to put the pins relating the #realm in the correct order.  
- The sanctum door puzzles follow the trail of [[Baron Herbert.S. Sinclair]] travels, I need to find the order in witch he visited each. 
- It is NOT the order on the [[Room 46#^f9a293|fireplace of 46]]
- The [[Sanctum Door 1#^842b70|Orinda Aries letter]] says he started there.
- The [[Sanctum Door 2#^d0d503|Fenn Aries letter]] says he ended there.
- The [[Sanctum Door 3#^410893|Arch Aries letter]] says he came from [[Eraja]]
	- According to [[Sanctum Door 3]] note, he traveled north to [[Arch Aries]], noting how it used to be possible by train.  Thus he must have come from either [[Fenn Aries]] or [[Eraja]].  but since he started in [[Fenn Aries]], he must have traveled from [[Eraja]] directly to [[Arch Aries]]
- The [[Sanctum Door 4#^a7b6d4|Eraja letter]] does not mention where he came from.
- The [[Corarica]] letter says he came from [[Verra]] and, it was the first realm he went to without porters.
- The [[Verra]] letter says he came from [[Mora Jai]]
- According to the [[Mora Jai]] letter, he went to [[Corarica]] after, but not necessarily directly.
- Came to [[Mora Jai]] via boat
