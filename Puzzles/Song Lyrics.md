 - After digging near [[The Campsite]] I have found [[The Conservatory]]!
 - Bold words in song lyrics create a sentence
 - There are probably multiple songs, I've seen a Blue, and a Brown song.
 - The sentence so far reads:
	  - "First Words On The ==Sheets== Are True Message"
 - However this doesn't seem to make sense, as the first words on each sheet of paper read the following.  Could "sheets" be referring to something else?  Surely not? #question 
	 - "Find Among The white Trees Under Two Stones"
 - This doesn't seem like the right answer.  I must be missing something.
 - Maybe [[The Music room#^564985|the other sheet]] in the [[The Music room]] is relevant?

		- Find here within these ==first== words sung. The key you seek  in  major tongue, But half the sheets are missing from. The four  you hold the rest far flung, A half note held is quite the pun.

		- Among this scattered symphony, A message hidden beneath the keys, In bold ==words== sung by you and me.  A fractured note, an urgent plea, in bold words sung, I do repeat.

		- The ones of you who oft assume.  That you alone can solve this tune, are likely going to get your due.  And all the rage that will ensue, While working ==on== this simple clue.

		- White pages lined with melodies.  Do hide the words we've come to seek.  And from our choice among all these, We write down one that seems to be, ==The== loudest type with ink that bleeds.

		- Trees found inside will never shade, The gems that shine in night and rain, The clue you hold can not be paid, With gems nor coin, so toss away, These ==sheets== you find a worthy trade.
- [[The Ballroom]]
	- ![[Pasted image 20251209094632.png]]
		- Under these stars, the dance is held.  And to the floor we ==are== compelled, The gowns glide on and music swells.  Ans at the end the clock strikes twelve, What that means only time can tell.
	- ![[Pasted image 20251209094637.png]]
		- Two remain for one last dance, And spin again around clock hands, And as they turn, a second chance.  To rise above the falling sands.  The ==true== time lost in past romance.

		- Stones cut by hand, and letters wrought.  Do spell our secrets carved from thought, A ==message== read is often lost.  Among the bold words, spoken soft, The note is read, the letter is not.
