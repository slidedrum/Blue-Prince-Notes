		- The last cables have finally been laid and the [[office terminal]] has been connected to the central network. Given the ever-changing nature of the rooms on the estate, we chose to install the server outside of the house to maintain connection stability at all times. A small [[The Black Bridge Grotto|cavern off of the eastern drive]] was selected for the server site.

	- 01-26-86 - [[Randolph Moore|MoorR]] (All)
		- All remaining computer [[Terminal|terminals]] on the estate are now connected to the [[The Curse Of BlackBridge|network mainframe]] and we will now begin testing remote access capabilities between them.  
		- I've also asked [[Baron Herbert.S. Sinclair|the Baron]] to come up with a name for the Network.
- ![[Pasted image 20251222125618.png]]
	- 01-30-86 - [[Randolph Moore|MoorR]] (All)
		- After some deliberation, our network has been named [[BLACKBRIDGE]], a somewhat ominous name for the project given the legend from which the [[The Curse Of BlackBridge|term derives]], though very fitting considering we chose an actual cave to house the mainframe.  
		- I only hope that our servers do not suffer that same fate that befell those in [[The Curse Of BlackBridge|the story]]!
- ![[Pasted image 20251222125623.png]]
	- 07-01-86 - [[Randolph Moore|MoorR]] (All)
		- Regular maintenance Report - Fixed a connection error that was occurring between [[The Office]] and [[The Security Room|security]] [[terminal]]. We have also added electronic mail capabilities to each [[terminal]] that can be accessed via the network.

	- 02-10-87 - [[Bo Lee|LeeB]] (Delisted)

	- 02-16-87 - [[ProvC|ProvC]] (Delisted)
		- [[Bo Lee|Lee]], we are planning something later this year and need to make sure communication on here is not being archived. Are there additional steps we can take to ensure privacy?
	- 02-16-87 - [[Bo Lee|LeeB]] (Delisted)
		- Already taken care of, we are now bypassing message archiving. [[Randolph Moore|Randolph]], shouldn't notice anything out of the ordinary.
- ![[Pasted image 20251222135536.png]]
	- 02-17-87 - [[ProvC|ProvC]] (Delisted) ^d61efa
		- Good, no one else on the estate knows we're here. Other than [[Marion Marigold - Mary Matthew Epsen|Mary]] of course, who saw [[Bo Lee|Lee]] on Tuesday but \[[[HounU|HounU]]\] has a plan to take care of her. ^ebc147
	- 02-18-87 - [[Bo Lee|LeeB]] (Delisted)
		- If it must be done, it must be done. Just see to it that the body is not discovered. The last thing we need is for the [[Redguard|Red Guard]] to be snooping around here.
- ![[Pasted image 20251222135604.png]]
	- 02-21-87 - [[HounU|HounU]] (Delisted)
		- She won't be found. Rest assured.
			- This lines up perfectly with the newspaper clipping of her disappearance in the [[Archive Newspapers]]
	- 02-21-87 - [[Bo Lee|LeeB]] (Delisted)
		- Let's disperse for now. I'll meet you all at the safehouse in [[Reddington]] in four days. Then, once the inquiry is over, we will proceed with our plans for the museum.
			- I think the safehouse is the old [[BlackBridge Admin Logs#^4d725d|schoolhouse]]

		- Resuming operations.
	- 06-27-87 - [[ProvC|ProvC]] (Delisted)
		- Welcome back Lee. I've been camping out of the old [[The Schoolhouse|schoolhouse]] for the past month waiting for your return. It's spacious, quiet, and should prove to be an effective base of operations, outside of the purview of the staff and [[Baron Herbert.S. Sinclair|the Baron]]. ^4d725d

	- 07-10-87 - [[Bo Lee|LeeB]]
		- We should have an opening on the first day of September. Can we be ready by then?
	- 07-13-87 - [[HounU|HounU]]
		- I don't see why not. Negotiations for transportation are in the final stages. If all goes well we will have air passage to [[Nuance]] secured for that date.
- ![[Pasted image 20251222125646.png]]
	- 07-25-87 - [[Randolph Moore|MoorR]] (Admin)

		- I think [[Randolph Moore|Moore]] is planning a scheduled maintenance soon, so we should likely wrap things up here.
	- 08-25-87 - [[HounU|HounU]] (Delisted)
		- I'd say it's time to scrub these logs, they might fall under some scrutiny in the near future.
	- 08-26-87 - [[Bo Lee|LeeB]] (Delisted)
		- \[[[ProvC|ProvC]]\] and \[[[HounU|HounU]]\] and \[[[Bo Lee|LeeB]]\] delisted and deleted from User Database.

	- 11-25-92 - [[Randolph Moore|MoorR]] (All)
		- R.T.A. is down while we work on a solution to reported [[terminal]] connection failures.
			- Remote Terminal Access?  Idk what else that could possibly be, and it fits to well for me to question it.
	- 11-28-92 - [[Randolph Moore|MoorR]] (All)
		- R.T.A. is working again. [[Terminal]] connections tested and confirmed functional. To make future testing easier, added ability to access offline [[Terminal|terminals]] through the R.T.A. when [[The Black Bridge Grotto|Blackbridge]] is open.
