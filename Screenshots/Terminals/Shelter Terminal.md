#terminal 
When in [[The Shelter]] you can access this [[terminal]]
- It has 3 options
	1. Time-Lock safe
		- One of the [[8 Safes]]
		- You can set a date and time to unlock the safe, and inside is [[Red Letter 7 (Courtney)]]
		- I have already completed this puzzle.  I don't think this option is useful anymore.
	2. Radiation Monitor
		- If you've done a lot of [[Lab Experiments]] today, and there is more than 12 uSv all doors in the house will unlock.
	3. Login to network
		- Allows you to see the standard network options with the password "Swansong"
		- See [[Shared Terminal]]
