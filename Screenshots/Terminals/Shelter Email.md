	- Yes, and don't worry - this communication method is fully secure. I am the only lab technician with network access and the only one who uses this terminal. I'm working to get you some more supplies, but I'm not focusing on essentials as I believe there's enough food in the shelter to last for the duration. Though I think it'd be wise if you can do a quick inventory to confirm that.
		- Who is the recipient of this email? #question 
		- I'm fairly sure it's [[Marion Marigold - Mary Matthew Epsen]]
			- But according to a note from [[Baron Herbert.S. Sinclair]] he doesn't know where she is.  
			- But according to other emails from this terminal, it mentions someone's uncle, and investigating her disappearance.  Which would fit with it being marigold.

	- In terms of area, there's not nearly as much room here as I remembered from my youth. If it was just me, I wouldn't mind, but with four of us and the space we are going to need for planning I don't expect this to be a sustainable situation for more than a week. A fortnight at best. ^ba4327
		- Who are the 4 people down here?  The 4 from the [[Museum Heist]] probably? 
			- [[Marion Marigold - Mary Matthew Epsen]]
			- [[Mr. Phillip White]]
			- [[Farro]] (Who?  #question )
			- [[Caleb Manning]]

	- I passed the message on and [[Baron Herbert.S. Sinclair|your uncle]] says he may have an idea for a more long term solution but it's going to require some doing. I'm not sure exactly what he has in mind but this morning when I looked at today's blue prints, I saw he had drafted the pump room, a floorplan I haven't seen used in a very, very long time.   ^3d5867
	- I have a feeling you all may be taking a boat ride shortly.

	- It's finally happening.  We just got confirmation from our source that the [[Redguard]] is coming tomorrow to begin their formal inquiry into the disappearance. At this point, it's going to be too risky to move you until next week at the earliest. Just hang tight for now.
