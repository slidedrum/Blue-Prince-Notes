![[Pasted image 20251222095811.png]]
A small wooden chest often found in rooms, always locked, and usually containing a few items of interest.

- Not really an item, but it shows up in the [[The Security Room]] inventory so I'm counting it
- Requires a key (or [[Sledgehammer]]) to open.  Contains random items.
