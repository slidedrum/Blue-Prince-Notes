The Estate refers to all the explorable areas of Mt. Holly including the rooms currently drafted, as well as the grounds.  The House, on the other hand, is only referring to the current rooms, as shown on the Mt. Holly Blueprint.

- There is a statue on the easter side of the estate.  I think it is of a [[monks]] #need-screenshot  not sure.
