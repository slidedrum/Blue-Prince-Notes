#terminal 
- When in [[The Security Room]] you can access this [[Terminal]]
- It has 4 options:
	- View Estate Inventory
		- Shows all current [[Items]]/[[world objects]] in the current layout.
	- Keycard System
		- Lets you change [[Security Keycard]] settings
		- Security level: low/med/high
			- Should be low when you can't open [[Keycard Door]] and high when you can.
		- Offline Mode: Locked/Unlocked
			- Paired with [[The Utility Closet - Breaker Box]] allows you to open [[Keycard Door]] without a [[Security Keycard]]
			- Should always be set to unlocked, I have not found a single reason to keep it locked.
	- Login To Network
		- Allows you to see the standard network options with the password "Swansong"
		- See [[Shared Terminal]]
	- Exit
		- Closes the window
