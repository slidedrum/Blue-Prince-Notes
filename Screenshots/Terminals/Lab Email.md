	- As I know you've been conducting temperature-related experiments this past week, I've tried my best to avoid accessing my frozen stock during your normal working hours, however, on Friday I was making my famous black truffle pizza and had to visit [[The Freezer]] for a few ingredients. I hope I didn't mess anything up!

	- Please don't worry too much about [[The Freezer|freezer]] access. The [[Lab Experiments|experiments]] we're doing aren't very sensitive and they are already accounting for normal variations due to expected use and staff traffic. However, surprisingly, we did see a major temperature rise on Friday which I believe may be related, not to your [[The Freezer|freezer]] visit, but to the use of [[The Furnace|furnace]] in close proximity.  
	- In the future, you should try to [[Drafting|draft]] that a bit further away, as the temperature rise from [[drafting]] that room has a major effect on temperature in the house and even more so in rooms in close proximity to it.

	- As we discussed in our meeting earlier this week, we will be sealing off the entrance to the [[The Curse Of BlackBridge|Blackbridge]] server this week (as well as archiving all our electronic mailboxes and locking access). I'm not sure just how tech savvy we expect the [[Redguard]] to be but there's more than enough data on our servers that these extra precautions are, in my opinion, the very minimum measures that we should be considering given the likelihood of an investigation next month.
