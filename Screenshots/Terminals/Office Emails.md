	- The [[The Utility Closet - Breaker Box#^d0dc00|v.a.c. indicator lights]] installed per instructions have been turned on.  
	- However, it should be noted that the WHITE Indicator is only displayed after syncing all 6 indicators to PURPLE.  
	- If this is not the desired functionality, let us know and we will fix it in our regular service visit next week.

	- [[gabe DCPOWER|Gabe]] - YES - that is the correct functionality.  
	- Also, when you are out here next week, please test that the correct sequence is:  
	- \[ off \] \[ blue \] \[ green \] \[ white \] \[ red \] \[ purple \]  
	- Thanks for the due diligence on this project.

	- [[Baron Herbert.S. Sinclair|Sir]],
	- You have not left me any instructions for the following week and you know how much I hate leaving critical plans up until the last minute. As soon as you decide on definite plans for the holidays, please pass a message on to me, either through [[Hartley Ruota|Hartley]] (who is valeting for you this weekend) or if you absolutely insist through this confounded electronic typewriter. ^bc6d3c

	- Dear [[SIMON P. JONES]], 
	- We, the undersigned, would like to inform you, as the CONTINGENT HEIR of Mount Holly, that while you are exploring the estate, the staff have been placed on indefinite paid leave.  
	- You have the full right and privilege to spend as much time on the estate as you deem fit without the interruption and supervision of the staff. It is entirely at your discretion to decide when and if the staff are to return to their duties.  
	- ~ [[McGuire]], [[McKinnely]], and [[McDougal]]

	- [[Simon P. Jones|Simon]],  
	- Just to let you know, a few of us on the staff have a habit of using the [[STAFF ANNOUNCEMENTS]] board that is located on the network under [[Shared Terminal#^bdb99d|STAFF SERVICES]]. You may notice new announcements from time to time.  
	- This is convenient as most of the staff, who are interested, have access to the public terminal in [[SYNKA]] while very few, like [[Randolph Moore|Randolph]] and [[Mrs Anne Babbage|myself]], have electronic mail capabilities.
