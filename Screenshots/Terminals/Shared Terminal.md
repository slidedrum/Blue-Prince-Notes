	- Special Orders.
		- This will let you order a specific item. I think these items show up in [[The Commissary]] though it feels like they should be in [[The Mail Room]] but they aren't there.
		- Available items:
			- [[Brass Compass]]
			- [[Magnifying glass]]
			- [[Metal Detector]]
			- [[Running Shoes]]
			- [[Shovel]]
			- [[Sleeping Mask]]
			- [[Sledgehammer]]
		- ![[Pasted image 20251221151130.png]]
			- If you would like to get a specific brand of gum or your favorite fruit, [[The Commissary]] is now taking Special Orders for all members of the staff.
			- (Special Orders can take 1 - 3 days)
			- I think this just means the items is guaranteed to be buyable in [[The Commissary]], not that you directly get the [[Items]]
