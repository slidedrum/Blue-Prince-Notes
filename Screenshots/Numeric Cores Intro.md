	- Numeric Cores
	- By the Third Era, Numeric Cores had fallen completely out of favor and were no longer being included in proofs by serious arithmeticians. This concept, once considered sacred, was now regarded as an "overengineered concept that only served to slow further advancements in the field", as Phillip Wilkins once famously put it.
	- STEPS TO FIND A NUMERIC CORE
	- Take any number with four or more digits. Without changing the sequence, split that number into four smaller numbers. (ex. 86455 becomes 8 6 45 5)  
	- Next, assign each a different color, resulting in a valid mathematical equation that produces the smallest whole number possible. The first number should always be assigned teal to begin with a positive number. (ex. + 8 - 6 x 45 / 5)
	- + 8 * 6 - 45 + 5
	- If the result is a number with more than three digits, repeat the above process. The final number you obtain that is less than four digits is considered the "numeric core" of the larger number. (ex. 18)
