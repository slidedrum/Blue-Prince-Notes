	- Dear [[Simon P. Jones|Simon]],  
	- As I've been running out of ideas of my own, yesterday I asked [[Kirk Darren]] if he had any additional security advice I could pass on and to my surprise he gave me an envelope and directed me to include it in my next correspondence to you. I did not ask him what it contained, so I'll be very curious to hear from you after this is all over and find out whether or not it was of any use.  
	- Until next time,
