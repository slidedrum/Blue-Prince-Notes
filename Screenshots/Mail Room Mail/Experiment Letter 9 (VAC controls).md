	- [[Simon P. Jones|Simon]],  
	- Just in case it wasn't explicit in the emails, I decided to contact D.C. Power directly and get some additional usage instructions for the V.A.C. system they installed.  
	- This information is actually as much for me as it is for you, as I often spend ten minutes in [[The Utility Closet - Breaker Box|the Utility Closet]] just pressing random buttons until coming up with the desired result but I rarely understand exactly how it is I get there!  
	- After half an hour on hold, I finally got to speak the technician who personally designed the system and compiled a list of helpful operating instructions. I'll add that material on a separate sheet I'll include with this letter.  
	- As always, hope this helps you,
