	- Not sure if you paid too much attention to the machine in the booth in [[the lab]], but I figured I could save you some frustration if you've been fooling with it. This contraption is the central control for power lines that run externally from the house. In the past we've served as an emergency power source for the local community as we have modest hydroelectric capabilities with a steam turbine.  
	- If you want to use it, you'll need to first turn on the turbine in [[the boiler room]] and utilize our [[Vents|steam ducts]] to connect the turbine to [[the lab]]. This isn't required of course, and I can't think of any reason in which you'd have to use the boiler to reach [[Room 46]], but feel free to play around with it should you feel inclined to experiment.
