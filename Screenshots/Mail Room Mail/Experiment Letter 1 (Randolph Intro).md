	- [[Simon P. Jones|Simon]], 
	- My name is [[Randolph Moore]]. I am the lead lab technician at [[Synka]] and I have worked here at [[Estate|Mount Holly]] for over a decade. I was thrilled to discover you have found our [[The Lab|humble lab]] and have begun to run some [[Lab Experiments|experiments]] of your own. I tend to keep an eye on the small spikes in [[radiation levels]] on the estate as it's one of the only ways I can monitor your progress from the outside. (All off-site connections to the [[terminal]] network have been disabled during your stay.)  
	- There has been much speculation among the staff about the progress you've been making in the house and they were all quite excited when I reported that you have been successfully running [[Lab Experiments|experiments]]! I wanted to write to you to let you know that even though you may not see us, we are rooting for you!  
	- Best of luck on the [[Lab Experiments|experiments]] and if you like I'll continue sending letters with some helpful tips for you.
