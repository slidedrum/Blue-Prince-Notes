- After almost 3 years in the tunnels, [[Scripts & Rudford Mining Company|S&R]] has informed  me that we will be closing up the site in June. It has  been a somewhat bitter-sweet experience working on such a historically significant excavation over the past 30 odd months yet being unable to share any of that work  with the world. Maybe one day.  
- Still, there is a significant amount of work that has  yet to be done and it is vitally important that we  conclude our efforts in the main cavern and reinforce the structural integrity of the site before we seal the tunnels next month. It may be many generations before  they are reopened.
