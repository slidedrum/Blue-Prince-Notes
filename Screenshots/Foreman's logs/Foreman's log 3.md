	- As our client [[Baron Thomas Sinclair|Tomas Sinclair]] suspected, the arches that were  visible from the south cliff were part of a much longer  arcade carved into the rockface. Last week, when our crew  first arrived, only two supporting pillars were visible,  but after only a few days of clearing vines, moss and dirt,  we have uncovered a dozen more.  
	- Our exploration, so far, has been limited and entirely  superficial as every shaft we have surveyed has ended  abruptly and every promising path leading deeper into the  mountain has been blocked by tunnels packed tight with  soil, rock and debris. 
	- This site is either much older than we had first assumed or  someone deliberately had these chambers buried.
