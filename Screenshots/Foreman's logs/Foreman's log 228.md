- After 10 days of pumping water up from the underground spring, [[The Reservoir]] has finally been filled. It's a  shame that the [[The Safehouse - Royal Station|old station]] had to be flooded as a consequence of this action, but I suspect that may have been the actual reason they chose to build the reservoir here and as an engineer I agree that flooding is  preferable to collapsing the entire tunnel.  
- On the bright side, now that our water supply is no longer limited, we can start to leverage steam to a much  greater extent. I suspect by this time next month, the steam-powered hoists at the main site will be able to run 24 hours a day.
