- Excavation progress is going smoothly and crew spirits  are higher than they have been in weeks. I believe this  increase in morale is in no small part due to the  installation of [[The Boiler Room|the boiler]] which has honestly been a  godsend. We now have steam power and no longer have to  rely on raw muscle to scrape and heave at the clay like  dogs.  The new steam-power hoists and winches are fully  operational and we have been able to unearth over five  times as much sediment per shift as we had been  previously excavating.
