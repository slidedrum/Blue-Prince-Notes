- Foreman's log: 102.  Date 1.13.1916
- I knew what we were looking at as soon as we  uncovered the first spire, but it wasn't until the  first floorplan was unearthed that most of the crew  realized what ruins we were exhuming. The border  was the same pitch as the sunless cavern we found it  in, a dark-trimmed floorplan of ill-fated [[Orindia]].  
- We had found an authentic [[Blackprint]].  
- The sooner we seal this site back up, the better for  us all.
