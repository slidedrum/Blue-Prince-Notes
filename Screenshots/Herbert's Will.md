	- The last WILL and TESTAMENT, 
	- of me, [[Baron Herbert.S. Sinclair|Herbert S. Sinclair]]  
	- ---
	- I, [[Baron Herbert.S. Sinclair|Herbert S. Sinclair]] of the [[Estate|Estate]] at [[Reddington]], do publish and declare this instrument my last will and testament. and hereby revoke all wills and codicils heretofore made by me.  
	- I declare that I am not and have never been married and have no children.  
	- ---
	- First, I direct that all my debts and outstanding expenses be paid as soon after my decease as possible.  
	- ---
	- Secondly, I direct all the servants and staff in my employ at the time of my death shall be granted indefinite leave to be paid out of the reserves of [[Estate|my estate]] set aside for such occasion, until such a time as a [[Simon P. Jones|new master of Mount Holly]] bids their return. In the event that the aforesaid reserves for this purpose are depleted before a new master of the estate is found, I direct my executor to make provisions for their future employment, and to do so in a manner that is just and equitable to all parties involved.

	- Thirdly, to my faithful valet, [[Hartley Ruota]], I hereby gift to him the lake house in [[Trinsdale]] as a small measure of gratitude for his many years of unwavering loyalty and devoted service. I direct that my executor take such steps as are necessary to transfer ownership of the said lakehouse to [[Hartley Ruota]] and should use all reasonable efforts to persuade him to accept the same.  
	- ---
	- Furthermore, to my late cousin [[Tillynn]]'s two children, [[Courtney Ferrine]] and [[Rygard Ferrine]], who have sometimes been impulsive and hasty in their actions, I grant to each a cuckoo clock set eternally on the sacred hour, for only time will tell when they are ready to slow down enough to appreciate the gifts bestowed upon them with the patience and wisdom that comes with maturity.  
	- ---
	- In the case that [[Lionel Epsen]] should return from his travels abroad, or in the event that any of his heirs should present themselves, I bequeath to him or them, as the case may be, the diary and its related key, which formerly belonged to his sister, [[Lady Clara Epsen|Clara Epsen]], which I have kept in her room and beside her grave, respectively (and respectfully).

	- In addition, it is my fervent desire that [[the GALLERY]], along with all the artwork contained within be bestowed upon the [[Reddington Museum of Art]], including the sculptures, exhibits and the entire collection of drawings by [[Christopher Manson]], comprised of four pieces entitled T~~hink~~, P~~onder~~, R~~ealize~~ and R~~uminate~~ . This generous donation shall be made one year hence, following the date of my earthly departure (when it will be removed from [[House|Mount Holly]]'s [[Drafting Pool|draft pool]].)  
	- ---
	- Moreover, to [[the Grand Cathedral of Eraja]], I bequeath eight stone statues, sculpted in the likeness of the eight [[Ajeran Angels]]: [[Orinda]], [[Lydia]], [[Rynna]], [[Joya]], [[Dauja]], [[Veia]], [[Mila]], and [[Draxus]]. These sculpted figures have been in the [[The Tomb|Sinclair tomb]] for multiple generations, and, even though there has been much debate over their natural numeric order, they have nevertheless remained steadfast in their safeguarding of our family's secrets. I trust they will continue to provide [[the Grand Cathedral of Eraja|the Cathedral of Eraja]] that same level of stewardship.

	- I give and bequeath, to my grandnephew, [[Simon P. Jones]], son of my dear niece [[Marion Marigold - Mary Matthew Epsen|Mary Matthew]], all the rest, residue and remainder of [[Estate|my estate]], and of my right, title and interest in and to [[House|the house]] and land which I own near [[Mount Holly]] as a token of the cordial and affectionate friendship which for nearly a half century his grandmother, [[Lady Clara Epsen|Clara Epsen]] has shown me.  
	- The above provision and bequest is contingent on my aforementioned [[Simon P. Jones|grandnephew]] discovering the location of the [[Room 46|46th room]] of my 45 room [[Estate|estate of Mount Holly]]. This room among other things of value holds the physical deed to the entire estate as well as many other personal effects and policies of insurance. The location of the room has been kept a secret from all the staff and servants of the manor, but I am confident that any heir worthy of the [[sinclair family|Sinclair]] legacy should have no trouble uncovering its whereabouts within a timely manor.  
	- Should my [[Simon P. Jones|grandnephew]] fail to uncover this room or provide proof of his discovery to the executors of my will then this gift shall lapse and the above clauses (on this page) and provisions pertaining to that clause shall be considered null and void and the rest of my estate shall be disposed of and gifted to the [[Orindian Heritage Foundation]], under condition that [[House|the house]] be immediately winnowed and sealed with explicit instructions and allowances that the site shall not be reopened until black flags are once again flying over [[Oris (Town)|Oris]] or One Hundred and Ten years have passed since my death, whichever day shall come first.
		- The final sentence saying he wants the black flags back is saying that he supports the old guard of [[Orinda Aries]] and not the new [[Fenn Aries]]

	- As one final gift to my grand-nephew, [[Simon P. Jones]], regardless of whether he finds [[Room 46]] or not, I leave and bequeath to him the original manuscripts of [[Marion Marigold - Mary Matthew Epsen|his mother]]'s works that were produced here, under the roof of her childhood home. These preliminary draft copies include [[The Red Prince Manuscript|RED PRINCE]] which she wrote while visiting the estate during the brightest of her days, and [[A New Clue Manuscript|A NEW CLUE]] which she penned here during the darkest.  
	- I hope that in due time and in the natural order of things, you will come to be content, as I have, with what little of herself she left us.  
	- ---
	- IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this 18th day of March, Nineteen Hundred and Ninety-three,
	- [[Baron Herbert.S. Sinclair|Herbert S. Sinclair]]
