	- Dearest [[Marion Marigold - Mary Matthew Epsen|Mary]].  
	- I know the events of the past year have catapulted you into a world you may not have been ready for. It's cruel, the way time rips through our lives leaving them barren and fruitless like wind-scarred plains.  
	- Throughout this all, I know your principal concern has always been [[Simon P. Jones|Simon]]. You didn't need to confide in me yesterday for me do realize that fact. Everyone who knows you understands this.  
	- I will take full responsibility do ensure that regardless of how your current project pans out, [[Simon P. Jones|Simon]] is shielded from any fallout and god forbid, repercussions. a child should never suffer the iniquity of their parents.

	- [[Baron Herbert.S. Sinclair|l]], of course, write you all this in the hope that I can set your mind at peace when imagining the worst case scenarios, not because I think such an outcome is likely. no, [[Marion Marigold - Mary Matthew Epsen|Mary]]. I have few apprehensions and fewer fears. assuming everything goes according to plan, you should be reunited with [[Simon P. Jones|Simon]] again before his 10th birthday. and while two years might seem like an eternity to a mother, I've always heard the days pass by more quickly in the east.  
	- As for me and you, I have already come to terms that our meeting yesterday was very likely our last.  
	- I am too old and too stubborn do ever leave this place. I am too attached to the home our family has built up,

	- room by room.  Yes, I have a strong premonition / will be buried in red soil, under red flags. a compromise I know you yourself would never accept.  
	- Its been a joy watching you grow up and getting lo know you. Your mother and I spoke of little else during your school days. I know she'd feel the same bittersweet pride I feel now, do see you following in [[Simon H. Sinclair|your father]]'s footsteps and making the same sacrifices he did.  
	- Farewell my marigold, We may yet meet again, 
	- Your [[Baron Herbert.S. Sinclair|Uncle Herbert]]
