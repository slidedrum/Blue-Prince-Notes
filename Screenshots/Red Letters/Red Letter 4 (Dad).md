	- [[Baron Herbert.S. Sinclair|Herbert]],  
	- I was distraught to learn that you have chosen to omit the details of our dear [[Marion Marigold - Mary Matthew Epsen|Marion]]'s '[[Marigold's Disappearance|disappearance]]' from the public record.   ^b5a36d
	- It is no surprise to me that the Royal Court would want this embarrassment kept as quiet as possible, but I am shocked that you have so little regard for your niece that you would play the king's scullion and stoop to kissing the foot that treads upon her memory.  
	- She gave up her family, her fortune and her life and all you can do is think of your name.

	- Having never had a family name nor fortune of my own, I cannot personally condemn you for faltering in your commitment to make the same sacrifices she did. But for the love of god, do not by that same display of weakness clutch your petty assets so tightly that you undermine the cause that she forfeited everything to further.  
	- Our countrymen must be made aware of the price she paid and must be made to see the color of the flag she flew as she rode into the darkness of a hundred nights.  
	- To deny her story is to deny her life.

	- If through your silence you bless this betrayal, our son, Simon, your heir, will inherit a fortune of lies and will spit  upon your grave when he learns of your cursed foolishness.  
	- Needless to say we will not be coming for Christmas this year,
