	- March 3rd  
	- Dear [[Baron Herbert.S. Sinclair|Mr. Sinclair]],  
	- Thank you for promptly answering all [[Room 46#^102e7a|our demands]], not involving the police, and allowing this unfortunate transaction to transpire as smoothly as one could hope.  
	- And while I'm guessing you had hoped to never hear from us again once we had given you back the envelopes, we felt that one final [[Red Letters|red letter]] of our own was merited given the circumstances. Hopefully, you will not be as careless with this missive as you were with the others.  
	- Correspondence this incriminating should be kept in [[8 Safes|safes]], not desk drawers.  
	- Let's first put your apprehensions aside, as I'm sure another red envelope is the last thing you expected to find on your desk this week. No, we are not making more demands, and no, we do not have "copies" of the other letters.

	- You were already more than generous and accommodating and the least we can do is fulfill our end of the bargain. So why write to you at all? Why incriminate ourselves further if we already have what we want? In a word, principles.  
	- After reading your eloquent reply to our initial note, it became apparent to us that there had been a few misunderstandings. This letter is intended to clarify some of those points, and hopefully will place our schemes in a softer light.  
	- First, we may have gotten too excited with the colorful language of blackmail but our goal was never to terrorize. Despite what you may believe you interpreted as thinly veiled threats towards your young [[Simon P. Jones|nephew]], I want to personally assure you there was never any tangible danger. 
	- If we gave any impression we would hurt the youngster, it was meant only in the very vague sense of 'hurting his social prospects'. And yes, while we admit that

	- our word choices might be questionable (enough so that it would be reasonable to accuse us of being intentionally misleading), we hope you believe us when we tell you that this was not a calculated ploy to elicit payment.  
	- However, as payment has been received, there is nothing to be gained by scrutinizing the questionable ethics that were employed in our extortion of those funds. Little defense can be mustered on that score.  
	- Additionally, any judgmental tone you may have detected when we discussed the content of your stolen letters was entirely unintended. We want it on record, that we do not consider ourselves superior to you and [[Sinclair family|your family]] in any way, and are in fact, entirely sympathetic to the underlying cause that the letters pertain to (And you thought, this letter couldn't get more incriminating for us).

	- Again, we feel guilty as sin and only time will tell if the financial recompense will outweigh our culpability.  
	- Even though you will never hear from us again, we hope this parting letter will result in you thinking of us and our dealings, if not favorably, at least sympathetically.  
	- Sorry for the inconvenience.  
	- forever anonymous,  
	- [[Denny Revane|X]]
