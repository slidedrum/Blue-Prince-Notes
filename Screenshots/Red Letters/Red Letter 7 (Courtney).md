	- Dear [[Baron Herbert.S. Sinclair|Uncle]],  
	- The disappearance of my cousin [[Marion Marigold - Mary Matthew Epsen|Mary]] has long sat unfavorably with me and my father. And I will freely admit to you that the chilly airs of indifference you may have felt in my presence can be attributed entirely to the suspicions that I have harbored for these past years. Suspicions entirely aimed at yourself.  
	- And while I have never had the opportunity to prove it, I felt very strongly that you had some deeper involvement in those events four years ago. The circulating rumors of those months did nothing but further reinforce my convictions in this fact.  
	- Those of us that are once bitten are twice shy and I am aware of the cost my aggressively aloof behavior has had on the social standing of our family. I do not apologize for my actions, though I am now willing to admit that the conclusions I reached may have been flawed.

	- Last week, I had a confidential conversation with one of our mutual acquaintances. A conversation that has shed more light on this mystery than all of my father's countless fruitless inquiries over the years.  
		- Who is "one of our mutual acquaintances"? Someone else involved in the [[Museum Heist]]
	- I now have reason to believe that you were in fact responsible for smuggling [[Marion Marigold - Mary Matthew Epsen|my cousin]] under cover of night across the red border to the southern seafront. And I believe this may have occurred in September, a full 7 months after she was reported missing. A date that coincides not with her public "disappearance" in February but instead with the notable [[Museum Heist|theft of the Ruby Crown]].  
	- If the [[Black Water]] insurgents were in fact responsible for [[Museum Heist|the heist]] as some have claimed, I believe this scenario entirely plausible. And the fact that 2 of the crown's eight rubies have now surfaced has given me renewed optimism that she is still alive.  
	- Alive, safe and finally free.

	- Perhaps, my willingness to accept such a sensational story betrays my own desperation.
	- Desperation for answers. Desperation for hope. And desperation for a narrative in which you are not the villain.  
	- In that distant land we all dream of, the land where the strangling crimson curtains draped across our sky are pulled back, and the windows and shutters of discontent flung wide open. In that distant land, I pray one day to find our Marion safe, happy and absolved.
