At the back of [[Her Ladyship's Sleep Diary]] it has a drawing of the [[West Path]].  The whole book talks about sleeping and [[Call it a day|calling it a day]].  So maybe if I [[Call it a day]] on the [[West Path]] something will happen?  
Maybe I need [[Her Ladyship's Chamber]] drafted?  Or maybe something specific in the [[Outer Room]]?  Like [[The Tomb]]?  unlikely, but worth trying if it doesn't work right away.

I tried this and nothing seemed to happen?  But I might have just not seen what happened.
