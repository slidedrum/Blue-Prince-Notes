# Where I found them
- There are 3 microchips that make up a symbol for something.  Can't remember what #question it's on [[The Dining Room]] chairs too.
- One was inside the center of [[The Black Bridge Grotto]] when I first entered.
- One was in [[The Entrance Hall]], I had to break one of the [[vases]] with a [[Power Hammer]]
	- I found the clue to smash the [[vases]] in the book [[A New Clue]] from the [[The Library]]
- The third was found buried next to the [[West Path]].  Hinted at by the [[A New Clue#^b2f8df|corner case rooms puzzle]]
# What they do
- They can be used in [[The Black Bridge Grotto]] to open the door to [[Orindian Ruins]] to collect [[The Throne room]] floor plan.
- They can also be used on the [[Sundial]] in the [[Apple Orchard]].
	- Hints on how to open it were found in [[a new clue]] in the sign and colored book puzzle.
