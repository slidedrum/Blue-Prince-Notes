#item/resource
- Used to buy items in shops (Gold rooms)
- You can start each day with coins by collecting your [[Allowance]]
- Probably the easiest resource to collect.
- You can directly transfer coins into [[Gems]] or [[Keys]] in [[The Laundry Room]]
	- Sometimes it is useful to leave some coins in the house, before making this trade.  So you're not entirely out after the trade.
	- For example don't take everything from [[The Vault]] or [[The Treasure Trove]]
