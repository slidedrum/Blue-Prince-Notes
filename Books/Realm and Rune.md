# INTRODUCTION  
- When the scholars of the first era found any hidden things, either of a natural source or resulting from the creations of man, they were accustomed to record these in various signs with the aid of figures. They did this in order that the sigils of their realm might not be understood by strangers.  
- Historically speaking, [[Sanctum Realm Sigils|sigils]] are not a new tradition. They have been found in every era and every culture and predate both written text and heraldic arts. However, today when we use the term "sigil" we are referring specifically to [[Sanctum Realm Sigils|Realm Sigils]], those crude circular marks of designation found on royal artifacts, buildings and older documents.  
- This book was written to make simple the understanding of these fascinating glyphs and to clearly display the correlation between each sigil and the iconography of that realm's royal art. "How is the image of a leafless burning tree seen in geometric lines and what does that tell us of a Kingdom's history?" Each line, each circle, and each variation tells a story of the land. Even the adorned borders around the sigils have special meaning.

# THE SIGIL
- To understand a [[Sanctum Realm Sigils|Realm Sigil]], we must first dismantle the symbol and identify the individual elements that make up the whole.
- Pictured the [[Sanctum Realm Sigils]] for [[Fenn Aries]] ^0134fc
- Each Sigil is composed of 4 things:
- [[Realm and Rune#^d9ff2f|The core]], [[Realm and Rune#^603927|The Dividing Lines (Rays)]], [[Realm and Rune#^7790af|The Motes]] and [[Realm and Rune#^d60e9b|The Border]].

# 1. THE CORE
^d9ff2f
- Several example cores taken from well known sigils.  [[Orinda Aries]]  At the center of each sigil is a unique shape, different for each realm. If the core gives us a name then the rest of the sigil tells us the history behind that name.  
- Still, it is important to be able to identify and distinguish the core as a first step in deciphering any sigil as all the other parts are meaningless if we don't first know the place we are describing. 
- Several Example cores taken from well known sigils.
	- [[Orinda Aries]]
	- [[Fenn Aries]] 
	- [[Eraja]] 
	- [[Corarica]] 
	- [[Arch Aries]]

# 2. THE RAYS
^603927
- Spouting forth from the core will come several dividing lines, splitting the sigil into pieces. From one sigil to another, the rays will often differ in number, style and form. Studying the differences in these lines will immediately reveal several things about the realm.  
- TRANSPORTATION (the number of rays)  
- Counting the number of dividing lines in a sigil will reveal to us what method of transportation was prevalent in a realm. Were they a seaside kingdom that relied on ships or a desert domain that might have employed camels to cross the sandy expanse of their lands?
- ![[Pasted image 20251215045814.png]]
	- Naval capabilities. Ship routes. Seaports. The eight rays on these sigils resemble the directions on a compass rose.  
	- Roads. Streets. Carriages. The four rays here look like crossroads on a map.  
	- Horseback. Rough trails. Another sigil that uses four rays, however, these will always be configured to suggest a horse galloping.  
	- Train system. Locomotion. The three rays here are used in sigils for realms that rely on track based travel.  
	- Aviation. Dirigibles. Balloons. The five rays here suggest travel "above" the horizon.  
	- Camels. Pack mules. Arid or desert trails. Two rays to indicate a flat terrain.  
	- Turtleback travel. Five short rays that do not fully extend from the core to the border.

# WEATHER (the style of ray)  
- Identifying the style of the ray used in the sigil will show us what weather the kingdom considered native. Some are intuitive like the jagged lightning shaped lines to indicate stormy lands. 
- Straight black lines indicate a lack of unusual or harsh weather and normal temperatures.  
- FOGGY or misty weather is indicated when the ray has several horizontal slashes across one side.
- Wavy lines are used to indicate extreme HEAT. The scorched air and blazing sun cause the otherwise straight rays to appear shimmering.  
- A RAINY realm is indicated with rays of three vertical lines pouring down.  
- For more extreme STORMY weather, a jagged lightning shaped ray is used.  
- A ray dotted with falling circles is used for colder realms in which SNOW is a common *occurence*.  
- WINDY weather is displayed on sigils by the use of bent curved lines, rays buckling under the high winds.

# 3. MOTES   
^7790af
- On each sigil, floating between the rays are small figures called motes. From the shape and style of the motes used on a sigil we can tell the type of society a given realm proclaimed, if they considered themselves mighty in arms or blessed by artistic and economic fortune.  
- Tribal - A primitive realm. Hunter and gatherers.  
- Agricultural - Harvest and farming based society and culture.
- Martial - Militaristic nation engaging in generation spanning wars and heated arguments.  
- Metropolitan - Large city-state with a dense, urban and populous center.  
- Academic - A center for knowledge, advanced in various scholarly pursuits. These realms are home to many schools, universities and libraries.  
- Industrial - Engineering driven culture with a focus on manufacturing, invention and production.  
- Spiritual - An elevated reverence for nature, animals and the forces that guide us.  
- Poetic - A strong focus on the advancement

# 4. THE BORDER   
^d60e9b
- Around each sigil is an adorned edge serving as a container for the information within. There are eight different borders, each one corresponding to a different color. These borders always correspond to the banner and national colors of that specific realm.  White
- Black, Red, Violet, Pink, Green, Yellow, Orange, White

# PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER  
- By studying the core, rays, motes and border of a sigil, you should now be able to unlock the meaning behind what had previously been an undecipherable enigma.
