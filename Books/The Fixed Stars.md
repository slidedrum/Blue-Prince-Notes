	- PREFACE  
	- This book contains a complete star base, a list of constellations and the observed effects that accompany the appearance of each one.  
	- Depending on the number of stars that can be seen in the sky on any given day, different constellations of various sizes may be visible (sometimes more than one on a single day!)  
	- This book, a solid base for astronomy, will help you easily identify these constellations, impress your friends and discover the joy of stargazing.
