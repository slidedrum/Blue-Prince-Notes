# FOREWORD
- ~~[[Orindia]] was once~~ the name used to designate the realms of the eastern waters. ~~Though the term~~ is no longer ~~employed in the halls of politics, nor commonly~~ known to the average citizen~~, its memory flickers in the hearts of those who hail from th~~e ~~lands that it once encompassed, and many~~ of the elder generation, ~~in hushed circles~~, ~~still refer to themselves as Orindians.~~  
- ~~Yet,~~ we must ~~not let the flame of our history dwindle into the obscurity of whispered conversations, nor~~ permit our leaders to enjoin us to abandon ~~the name of our land. We must keep alive the embers of~~ our past ~~and preserve them for the generations yet to come.~~

# 1 [[The First Era (Ajera)|Ajera]] 
^e95904
- Most historians mark the beginning of [[The First Era (Ajera)|the first era]], often denoted as [[The First Era (Ajera)|Ajera]], by the ascension of the First king ~~of [[Orindia]]~~ whose name, [[Oris - First King Of Orinda Aries|Oris]], would later grace the burgeoning township in which he was crowned. [[Oris - First King Of Orinda Aries|Oris]] was known, before his coronation, as a prominent merchant lord of considerable means and affluence, whose sway in the region made him the ideal candidate for the unification of the surrounding provinces.  Regrettably, history is not always forthcoming, and the surviving records of those bygone days are mostly limited to trade agreements and sales receipts.  Nevertheless, we can deduce from these ledgers that [[Oris - First King Of Orinda Aries|Oris]] had but one aim: expansion. The territory spread forth from the heart of [[Oris (Town)|Oris]] and by the end of the first century, the ~~black banners of [[Orindia]] could be seen fluttering in every hamlet and hostelry, along every thoroughfare, from [[Oris (Town)|oris]], all the way to the western banks.~~ A new kingdom was born. ^019254

# II [[The Second Era|SECOND ERA]]

- It was the [[fourth king of Orindia|fourth king]] ~~[[fourth king of Orindia|of Orindia]]~~ who split this vast domain in three equal shares. Three Realms for his three children.  
- To the eldest, he granted the fields and mountains of his [[Oris - First King Of Orinda Aries|great grandfather]], the middle province and heartspring of the kingdom. The eldest accepted the gift ~~and called his new realm [[Orinda Aries]], after the angelic paragon of royalty, Orinda.~~  
- To the youngest, he bestowed upon him the realm of [[Arch Aries]], the land of the Northern Storms. A wild and untamed  expanse which at the time was not as developed but a good deal more vast than the eldest brother's lot.   ^21b0d8
- And to his middle child, his only daughter, he gifted her the southern region of [[Eraja]], ~~the mystical realm of the ancestors,~~ a land steeped in tradition, ~~magic and the poetry of the old tongue~~ ^a2d99e

# III [[the Third Era|THIRD ERA]]
- As [[the Second Era]] drew to a close, the three sovereign realms had achieved a period of remarkable progress and prosperity. Each of these distinct regions, ruled by their respective [[Sibling Monarchs]], had blossomed, cultivating the bountiful resources of their lands, and developing a unique character and culture that set them apart from one another.  
- Despite those differences, the [[Sibling Monarchs]] managed to maintain friendly relations throughout their lives, and were known for their cooperation in matters of trade and transportation. The succeeding generations of their heirs continued that tradition and [[the Third Era]] was defined by ~~the construction  of a vast network of railways that spanned the length and breadth of the land, linking the northern mountains of [[Arch Aries]] to the southern shores of [[Eraja]]. This development facilitated travel and~~ commerce  between the three realms, further strengthening their bond and laying the foundation for the promise of a prosperous and bright future~~, a promise that would unfortunately, as my readers will soon find, not be kept.~~ ^08b86b

# IV [[The Fourth Era|FOUTH ERA]] 
^3a9f94
- As the kingdom ~~of [[Orinda Aries]]~~ entered [[The Fourth Era]], a different kind of ruler took the reins of power. [[King Desilets III]] was a ~~king who listened to the voices of all his subjects, from the most influential advisors to the humblest of citizens.~~
- ~~He was a~~ king who often was seen ~~among the people, eating,~~ drinking ~~and conversing~~ - a sight that shocked not only the gentry and the court, but the masses as well, ~~who could scarce believe that they, as peasantry, would ever sup with the crown.~~  
- [[King Desilets III|Desilets]] was renowned as "The King of ~~the People" and it was therefore a surprise to~~ no one when he made the decision to move ~~the capital from the secluded mountains of [[Reddington]] to the public stage of [[Oris (Town)|Oris]], lea~~ving castle and court behind. The people were overjoyed by this choice, and ~~the city welcomed their king with open arms and great fanfare. Yet, not all were swayed so easily. There~~ were those that viewed the king's conduct to be unbecoming of his ~~station, and were wary of how readily he could be persuaded by the tears and tales of the~~ common folk.  These ~~dissenting~~ voices planted the seed~~s of discontent,~~ which took root in ~~the lawns and gardens of the nobles of Fenn, or as I have been instructed to say, the~~ [[City of Fenn|Grand City of Fenn]]. ^ee78f6

# V [[The Fith Era (Era of Ruin)|ERA of Ruin]] 
^399fed
- After the passing of [[King Desilets III]], [[The Fourth Era]] came to an abrupt end. Thankfully, the king died ~~naturally in his old age and surrounded by his people in [[Oris (Town)|Oris]], far away from the growing unrest among the western [[City of Fenn|city of Fenn]].~~  
- On the very next day, the 6th of October, ~~the self-proclaimed~~ [[Prince Leerson]] of Fenn declared himself the true monarch. This declaration was bolstered by a ~~surprising~~ number of supporters, due to the fact that [[Desilets IV]] shared ~~his father's good name but~~ little of his virtues.  
- As the prospect of civil war seemed inevitable, the realm's regiments were hastily recalled from  the frontiers to stamp out and put an end to the "Fennsurrection". However, instead of restoring order, what ensued was a savage and merciless campaign against their own people. The [[gardens of Fenn]], once a center of splendor, were transformed into a battlefield as the cries of the innocent echoed through the city's streets, stained in red. ^a7fa35

	- The brutality of [[the pacification of Fenn]] did not go unnoticed by neighbors. As sympathy for the city surged, allies came forward to lend support. Among them was the [[general of the Northern Regiment]] who, sickened by the barbaric actions of the other battalions, joined forces with [[Prince Leerson]] to form a formidable army. Together, they leveraged their political influence and favors to persuade the nearby realms of [[Arch Aries]] and [[Nuance]] to join their cause.  
	- However, even with the tide turning in their favor, victory did not come easy. [[The War Of The Fifth Era|The War]] of [[the Fifth Era]] lasted 22 long years, and saw buried one in every three men. [[Prince Leerson]] himself added another number to the casualties. However, even in death, he had won. [[Oris (Town)|Oris]] had fallen and with it the realm.^81a2f2 ^3aa5e2
	- The black flags that had flown for five eras were burned, and in their place, red banners were hoisted in honor of the fallen of Fenn. The few remaining members of the former royal family fled in fear of their lives to the south, forever exiled.

# VI [[The Sixth era|THE CURRENT ERA]] 
^e71c40
- Today, the realms inherited by [[Sibling Monarchs|The Three]], [[Fenn Aries]], [[Arch Aries]] and [[Eraja]] once again stand united as allies. Though the distance between our peoples has grown, our connection to this land remains as strong as ever. The spruce and birch that span across our realms serve as a constant reminder that we all share a common past. ~~And as those trees continue to grow, so do our hopes for a common future. A future where we are not defined by the colors of the banners we raise, but by that which connects us. A land that we each call home.~~ 
- For this is, despite everything else, a land rich in history, a land of myth and wonder, a land that sprung forth the greatest empire the world has ever seen, the land of our fathers, of our mothers, and of our children. 
- ~~This land is, after all that has happened ...~~
	- This seems like a quite passionate excerpt from someone who gives a shit.  Implies that the author [[Caleb Manning]] really cares about his home and it's history.  This supports his involvement with [[Museum Heist]] and potentially [[Trinsdale Bombing]] to be politically motivated by forces that want to erase his history.  Like the [[Fenn Aries Central Board Of Education]] that censored the [[History Of Orindia (Second Edition)|second edition]] of his book.
