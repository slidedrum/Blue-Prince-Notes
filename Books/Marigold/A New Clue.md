 - See [[A New Clue Manuscript]]
 - The signs on each page are important. I think it is instructions for someone to take route 8, and keep left so the reach tanner fork (whatever that is) warning them that turning right instead is a dead end.  and to record every stop (sign?)  But what the fuck does that have to do with me?  Idk what that means in context of the house.  However in context of the [[Museum Heist]] this could be a clear message. The [[Grade 9 (Exam)|final exam]] mentions these signs.  
		 - This is talking about the metro map!
		 - 8 - 7 - 3 - 10 - 1 - 13
		 - 8: Royal Station
		 - 7: Angel Tower
		 - 3: Aries Crossing
		 - 10: Tanner Fork
		 - 1: Oris Train hall
		 - 13: Dead End
	 - Route 8 (not route, station 8!) 
	 - Depart~~ure~~ (end cut off)

	 - Right turn sign (no text)
	 - Dead End

 - There is the suspects, all I know is they are under 18 and not rock and stone, and they are in the military (wtf?)
	 - This is a hint for the admin key [[Bo Lee|LeeB]] for [[The Black Bridge Grotto]] allowing me to see redacted logs.
 - The "Corner Case Rooms" had to read lower case letters on notes in those rooms.

	 - All he needed was to find a new clue,

	- He had looked high and low in all of the rooms,  
	- He had searched every corner in each of the tombs,  
	- In this particular case, he had checked every space.  
	- If he found a new clue, he'd know what to do.
	- Notably pictured:
		- [[Ruby Socketed Candlesticks]]
			- This is probably hinting at lighting them in [[The Tomb#^382c67]]
		- The royal statue seen in [[Tomb Statue Puzzle]]
		- A large [[Chess Pieces]] rook.
		- A stone brick with a grid of lines, possibly depicting the house layout. (probably not important).
		- A "keep left" sign. (Probably not important)
	- There are very small numbers next to some words, when placed in numerical order, it reads: ***“All checked corner case rooms had a low case clue found in the room”***

	- He looked and he looked under beds and in nooks,  
	- He questioned the maids, he questioned the cooks,

		- A sign that says "To Tanner Fork" pointing left.
	- I think this page is telling me not to look in the house, but to check books.  However this conflicts with what I understand about the [[A New Clue#^b2f8df|corner case clue puzzle]]
