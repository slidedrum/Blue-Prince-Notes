	- The Blue Prince
	- By [[Marion Marigold - Mary Matthew Epsen|Mary Matthew Jones]]
- ![[Pasted image 20251228151717.png]]
	- To my son [[Simon P. Jones|Simon]]
	- In whose eyes I see the world anew.

	- There was a Blue Prince,
	- Who sat on a Blue Throne,
	- He had a blue crown made of sapphires,
	- And a blue castle made of stone.
- ![[Pasted image 20251228151727.png]]
	- The prince had a love,
	- For all things Blue,
	- \"it's the only true color,
	- In my humble view.\"

	- He couldn't stand the tint,
	- of a hallway or a shop.
	- He couldn't stand the shade 
	- Of trees the green rooms brought.

	- He seldom talked to others,
	- For they rarely shared this view.
	- He never went to town,
	- Nor saw the flags they flew,
- ![[Pasted image 20251228151805.png]]
	- And do you know wich game,
	- The prince instead would play?
	- The one that made him happy,
	- Whenever skies were gray?
- ![[Pasted image 20251228151811.png]]
	- A game he had played,
	- In the house and the grounds,
	- And maybe you can guess,
	- From the clues that we have found,
- ![[Pasted image 20251228151815.png]]
	- It was a game full of rooms,
	- And the stories that we climb,
	- About a house full of lies,
	- and the truth that one prince finds.
- ![[Pasted image 20251228151819.png]]
	- And as you my reader
	- might already assume,
	- this game is quite near you
	- in fact in the same room.
- ![[Pasted image 20251228151826.png]]
	- A game about you, and the plans that you made,
	- About a blue prince and his blueprints,
	- The blue game we just played.
