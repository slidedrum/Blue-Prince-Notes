	- I am a **DARE BIRD!**
	- A daring a brave bird!
	- Diving so deep bird,
	- A ride on the wave bird!

	- There is not a **dare** 
	- I would not do.
	- There is not a depth
	- I would not dive to.

	- However, my friends
	- Are not very open
	- To the idea that I like
	- the sky less than the ocean.

	- Bird in the sky, 
	- Not in the sea!
	- That is what they say
	- when looking at me.

	- You are not sea bird.
	- You are not swim bird.
	- If you are friend bird,
	- Fly in the wind, bird.

	- And shouldn't you always 
	- Listen to friends?
	- For they know me best,
	- Or so they pretend.
- ![[Pasted image 20251210062427.png]]
	- So I **dare** not dive,
	- and I **dare** not swim.
	- And I **dare** not step foot
	- in the ocean again.
- ![[Pasted image 20251210062432.png]]
	- And I **dare** not smile,
	- and I **dare** not laugh.
	- For they will do it for me,
	- and on my behalf.
- ![[Pasted image 20251210062439.png]]
	- And I **dare** not dream,
	- and I **dare** not speak
	- For maybe my friends,
	- Won't like the real me.
- ![[Pasted image 20251210062443.png]]
	- And I will say goodbye
	- to my dreams and the sea
	- And wonder why daring
	- feels just like defeat.
