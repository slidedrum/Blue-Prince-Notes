	- ==This is a record of my many indiscretions and lapses of judgment. Should this logbook ever be found know that my guilt is exceeded only by my failings==
		- Guilt is referring to not only his threats in [[Room 46#^102e7a|room 46]] but also probably his participation in the [[Museum Heist]]
	- As the groundskeeper of a vast [[House|estate]], it is my responsibility to ensure the property remains well- maintained and beautiful all year round. From the many [[Green Room|green rooms]] of the manor to the sprawling lawns, it is my duty to attend to every aspect of the grounds, ensuring they are orderly, presentable and accessible so that they may be appreciated by both guests and the [[Sinclair family|family]]. ==That would be the day==  
	- This logbook, many years overdue, will serve as a record of some of my duties, discoveries and contributions I have made to the estate over the many years I have served here as groundskeeper and however many more are yet to come. ==not many apparently==

	- A few months ago I made a truly remarkable discovery in my role of [[Mount Holly|Mt. Holly]] horticulturist. Through years of breeding and experimentation, I successfully created a [[Gem Flowers|new species of flower]] with a fruit that resembles a [[Gems|gemstone]] in every detail. Although the fruit is not edible, it is nevertheless a marvel of nature, possessing all the beauty and brilliance of a genuine jewel, but with the added benefit of being entirely organic.  
	- Despite the creation of [[Gem Flowers|this flower]] being my proudest accomplishment to date, my joy was slightly curbed when I was informed by [[Randolph Moore]] that my employer's company, [[SYNKA]], had decided to deny my request to announce my discovery to the public, completely disregarding my years of hard work and dedication to this project. ^65cdc8
	- ==This decision was absolute rubbish==
	- I have poured my heart and soul into this project, investing countless hours of research and experimentation to create something truly extraordinary. I feel [[Gem Flowers|this flower]] has the potential to make a significant impact on the field of horticulture, and it feels like such a waste to keep a gem like this hidden away for quote: "further research". ^bb3ff2
	- ==As I suspected they wanted the flower to server primarily as a cheap way to produce resources for [[Special Floorplan|Special Floorplans]]==

	- I had high hopes for this logbook but I have struggled to find a reason to add another entry. My employer's decision earlier this year has left me feeling disheartened, and I find it difficult to find the motivation to continue in my work. I am aware that my disappointment is affecting my performance and I am reminded of that daily when I see the house plants slowly dying as I make my rounds.  
	- Perhaps I should quit.
	- ==I really, really should have.==
	- January 8th, 1991  
	- My ambition has been reignited! I overheard, perhaps with some prodding, that the employee contracts for the staff are kept within the [[Baron Herbert.S. Sinclair|Baron]]'s [[Room 46|private office]] on the tenth rank. A fact that I found quite remarkable considering that the house only has nine ranks. This all but confirms the long held suspicion that the rumored [[Room 46|forty-sixth room]] is in fact, north of [[The Antechamber]]. A suspicion that I had always considered too obvious to be plausible. 
	- As much as I wish to abandon all pretense of caring about my job to focus on this new project, I fear I must resume my gardening duties for the sake of appearances. It has, after all, been a long time since the north side of the house has received the groundskeeper's undivided attention. Let's trim the hedges and see what we find.

	- If there is a tenth rank, it is impossible to perceive its existence from the outside. So if it does exist, then I'm going to assume that reaching it can only be done through the ANTECHAMBER. Sadly, security has only gotten tighter in the years after Mary's disappearance and that room is no longer locked behind regular doors that can be opened by regular keys. No, that would be too easy. Instead, the Baron had remote access levers installed in several different rooms of the house.  
	- Funny enough, I already know the location of three of these levers, as one was recently installed in the GREENHOUSE and another two were installed in the SECRET GARDEN.
	- ==It's almost like they were choosing green rooms just to tempt me...==
	- Image matches another I've seen before.

	- March 10th, 1991  
	- Although these past few months of exploration have yet to yield the fruit I seek, I have, in that time, gained a much greater mastery of the estate and have stolen many glimpses behind the black curtain that veils her many secrets.  
	- Among the more exciting of my recent finds was the discovery of a hidden chamber in one of the outer rooms, sealed shut behind a false wall. The stale quality of the air and the unmistakable aroma of corroded metal lead me to believe that this chamber has remained sealed for many decades. Within it, I found a large vat and a copper still, their timeworn surfaces streaked with creeping veins of oxidation and rust. ^f45d6d
	- ==Resealed in January after deal in Reddington fell through==
	- I am unsure if these instruments can be restored to working condition, but if they can, I may yet find a use for the sugar beets and potato stores rotting away in [[The Root Cellar]].

	- August 4th, 1991  
	- At last! I have finally discovered a location of one of the north levers! It is deep underground in a location so far removed from any of the estate's plant life that had I been discovered, I would have been completely vulnerable without any excuse but curiosity to offer to my captor.  
	- As anxious as I was to pull it, I have decided to wait until the Baron is away as it reduces the risk of being caught significantly. And once he leaves, I don't think that a delay in returning will be too hard to engineer now that Christoph is under my thumb and beholden to do whatever I command.

	- Well, there's no turning back now. After finally reaching the objective I had been working toward for the last four months, I made an impulsive decision in the heat of the moment and took more than just my contract. I found something that I knew could give me the chance to make back some of the money I felt was owed to me and I grabbed the opportunity without really considering the consequences. Given that there is now only one missing file in the staff contracts, I have unwittingly left an incriminating trail leading directly back to me. My only hope is that they consider it too obvious to be plausible.  
	- I'm almost positive that I'm not going to get away with it, but at this point, I feel I owe it to myself to get what's coming to me, one way or another.
