#book 
- Found in [[Apple Orchard]]
- Written by [[Robert Nogula]] 
- Probably important learnings:
	- Inside the house is all electric, outside is all [[Gardener's Logbook#^2cb199|gas powered]].
	- Depending on where the room is drafted, [[Green Room]] will have a [[Gardener's Logbook#^fcfc84|differing yield]] 
	- Idk if [[Gardener's Logbook#^6cfb24|this]] is relevant or not? 
	- The statue in [[The Cloister]] was changed
	- There is a way to get to the center of [[The Cloister]] Explained elsewhere

	- When I first came on [[House|the estate]] in the capacity of the new groundskeeper, I was a little dismayed to find that my predecessor had kept no notes, no logbook, and no record of any kind regarding the various gardens and green rooms of the house under his care.  As a result of this improvidence, in the first few months of my post I suffered a number of embarrassing professional blunders that I believe could have been avoided with even a few scraps of imparting wisdom from the [[Denny Revane|previous groundsman]].  To that end, I will make an effort to make some record of my dealings on the estate, in as much as it pertains to horticulture and general tomfoolery.  - [[Robert Nogula]], Groundskeeper

	- Among my many commissioned duties, I have been tasked with the conservation and oversight of [[House|Mount Holly]]'s alluring grounds. My domain stretches from gate to gate and encompasses the [[Apple Orchard]], [[The Driveway|entrance drive]] and [[east yard]]. Fortunately for my workload the maintenance of the west grounds has not been a priority since [[Lady Clara Epsen|Lady Epsen]]'s death and the ensuing closure of the [[West Wing]].  
	- Nevertheless, I take some pride in my work, so I still endeavor to brush the [[West Path|west path]] weekly even if none but myself take notice.  
	- In addition to maintaining the grounds, there are eight [[Green Room|green rooms]] within the house that require some level of upkeep and light groundskeeping. The majority of these I discovered are only draftable on the perimeter of the house along the [[The East Wing|East]] and [[West Wing|West Wings]]. [[The Terrace]], [[The Patio|Patio]], [[The Veranda|Veranda]], [[The Morning Room||Morning Room]], [[The Greenhouse|Greenhouse]], and [[The Secret Garden|Secret Garden]] all fall within this category.

	- The Soil Survey
	- One of the first tasks I undertook as groundskeeper was to conduct a survey of the various plots of soil underneath each slot on both the East and West Wings of the house. And while I would have preferred a full survey of all forty- five plots of the house, it was clear that the inconvenience such an undertaking would produce was in no way worth the extra data, especially considering the rooms that would benefit from this survey only ever appear in the wings.  
	- To quantify soil quality, I measured the soil's capacity to support crop growth and maximize the promise of high yields. The survey ended up taking two weeks due to some difficulty reaching the higher ranks but the project was well worth the effort. As suspected, the room position has a direct relationship to the amount of fruit spread from gardens and the amount of flowers that can bloom in a Greenhouse. ^fcfc84

	- A few years ago, the Baron made the long overdue decision to switch from gas lighting to electrical power. The installation of the new system was a substantial undertaking as almost every room in the house had to be equipped with new fixtures and wiring.   ^2cb199
	- Thankfully, these renovations did not extend beyond the mansion's interior and all the lamps and equipment used outside of the house are still connected and powered by gasline, including but not limited to the orchard's smudge pots.
	- The smudge pots found among the apple trees here in the orchard are a critical necessity thanks to the cold temperatures and high altitude of the estate. These gas burning stack heaters prevent frost and should be kept on during the winter months to ensure a daily yield of apples.  
	- When the smudge pots are not in use, the orchard's gasline should be turned off to conserve resources for the estate's other gas powered machinery and appliances. ^6cfb24

	- After a few months of idleness I finally have a new cause to champion and I have submitted a request for a change of scenery. Specifically, I would like to replace the statue of [[Orinda]] currently in [[The Cloister]] with the much more appropriate angel, [[Rynna]]. After all, as beautiful as the statue is, shouldn't the greenery of Mt. Holly be governed by the paragon of Gardening?  Though amused, I do not think [[Mrs Anne Babbage|Anne]] took the request too seriously, though she did humor me and listened to me rave and pontificate on the subject for the better part of our lunch yesterday.
	- And she wonders why I avoid tending [[The Cloister]]? (Truth be told, I have forgotten how to access the inner garth and am too scared of chastisement to probe for the particulars for a third time!)
	- Pictured [[Rynna]] the angel
	- my best rendition, pretty good considering I have only ever seen [[Rynna]]'s depiction in [[The Chapel]]. ^fa7a53
