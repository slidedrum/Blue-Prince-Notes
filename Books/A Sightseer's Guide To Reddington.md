# The Botanical Gardens
- [[Reddington]]'s most popular attraction and a guaranteed crowd-pleaser, the [[Reddington Botanical Gardens|Botanical Gardens]], is loved by both locals and visitors for its [[The First Era (Ajera)|Ajeran]] canopy house and mausoleum, its petal-covered trails, and a mind-boggling variety of flowers. This is the reason springtime is [[Reddington]]'s busy season.

- Situated just east of town, the [[Reddington Botanical Gardens|Botanical Gardens]] offer a scenic and captivating tableau of the natural countryside. A cobblestone trail meanders past over 1,000 species of tropical plants, each remarkable in its own right, yet even more stunning set against the spectacular backdrop of the Reddington mountains. Allow yourself at least an hour to indulge in this picturesque walk, which concludes at [[Reddington Mainway Station Bazaar|Mainway Station]].

# [[Featherfall Keep]]
- You will find sitting at the base of [[Mt. Perma]], [[Reddington]]'s second highest summit, a historic site described by scholars as significantly important to the realm's past. [[Featherfall Keep]], the former home of [[Lord William Epsin|Lord William Epsen]], has until recently always been a private residence, serving as a family home to the [[The Epsin Family|Epsens]] since before the third era. 
- After the death of [[Lord William Epsin|Lord Epsen]], his oldest son, [[Lionel Epsen]], left the estate never to return; however, the [[Lady Clara Epsen|daughter]] stayed, maintaining the residence and its staff until her marriage in 1951. At that point, [[Featherfall Keep]] ceased to be a family residence; it began operating as a historic house museum and tourist attraction, and the estate was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1972.  
- It is still believed by many that [[Featherfall Keep|Featherfall]] was built by the [[Oris - First King Of Orinda Aries|first king]] of [[Orinda Aries]] when [[Reddington]] was still the capital. However, surfaced documents containing conflicting dates have recently cast some doubt on the long-standing myth.

# [[Trinsdale Lake]]
- Close your eyes and imagine tranquil, serene stillness, rolling fogs, clear water, and gliding swans. In the midst of all that beauty, sits [[Trinsdale Lake]], one of [[Fenn Aries]]' premier vacation destinations, exclusive for its more privileged citizens. The lakeside resort and cabins have been frequented by royalty and the realm's gentry for generations. However, on the southern shore of the lake, tourists are free to enjoy the views and rub elbows with the rich and famous in the [[Hundred Bells Tea Room]], which is open to the general public for lunch on Mondays and Fridays.

# [[Mount Holly]]
- At an elevation of 11,220 feet, [[Mount Holly]] is the tallest mountain in the [[Reddington]] range and the highest peak in the entire realm. Beyond the physical challenge itself, climbing [[Mount Holly Trail]] is a beautiful experience and one that many hikers and explorers will want to do at least once.  
- It's only a few hours from [[Reddington]] to get to the trailhead, and you won't need any local guides or special gear if you tackle the trail during the summer season. However, those willing to give this mountain a significant amount of planning and research will be greatly rewarded, whether or not they actually summit.  
- On the opposite side of the peak, far from the trail, rests the [[House|Estate of Mount Holly]], nestled between the summit's northern slope and saddle. This 80-acre mountain residence is almost as old as [[Reddington]] itself, however, unlike [[Featherfall Keep]], the property has been completely private since the closing of the [[Mount Holly schoolhouse]] in '66. Still, hikers will be able to appreciate the house's unique architecture at a distance from one of the trail's many north-facing overlooks.

# [[Reddington Mainway Station Bazaar|Mainway Station Bazaar]]
- For the sentimental tourists wishing to pick up a souvenir to remember their stay, one might try braving the [[Reddington Mainway Station Bazaar|Mainway Station Bazaar]]. But don't be too hasty. Without proper guidance, the [[Reddington Mainway Station Bazaar|Mainway Station]] can be a dangerous place. Located underground, this unique marketplace was once [[Reddington]]'s central railway station, in a time when the realm's trains were still in service. Now the turnstiles, footbridge, and platform have been appropriated and turned into a cavern of tents and torches.
