#location #not-visitable 
- A fancy restaurant(?) on the south side of [[Trinsdale Lake]]
- Often visited by the rich and famous.
- This was the last place [[Marion Marigold - Mary Matthew Epsen]] was seen before she [[Marigold's Disappearance|disappeared]] 
- Open to GA for lunch on Monday's and Friday's
	- Does that mean it's closed completely tue-thur? or still open to the rich and famous durring the whole week?  Probably doesn't matter?
