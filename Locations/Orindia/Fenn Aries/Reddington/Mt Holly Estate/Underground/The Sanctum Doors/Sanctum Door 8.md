	- By far my favorite realm I have visited during this trip, but I have always had a penchant for technology and am less moved by the beauty of nature than others. The soot-filled streets and soaring skyscrapers here are just as stirring to me as the mountains of [[Corarica]] or the beaches of [[Mora Jai]]. Perhaps I am just letting my childhood love of [[Dirigiblocks]] compromise my objectively. From the shops I have visited, il seems the series is just as popular here as il is back home. Speaking of home, as I look across the eastern sea, I can almost see its shores. I never thought that I would miss the sigh of red flags. ^f45fc0
