	- Despite my prejudice against Mother nature, l own that I have deeply loved my time here at [[Verra]]. The memories of the youthful trip I took here with my brother have been relentless, and as I have gotten older, I find less and less occasion do recollect on such trivial pleasures. One thing I do remember vividly which has not lost a single speck of charm are the famous turtles. Each visitor of [[Verra]], upon arriving, is lend one of these hard shell friends for the duration of their stay, to serve as both steed, guide and companion. I am still under the spell of island life, even if the weather here is much more severe than it was on [[Mora Jai]].
