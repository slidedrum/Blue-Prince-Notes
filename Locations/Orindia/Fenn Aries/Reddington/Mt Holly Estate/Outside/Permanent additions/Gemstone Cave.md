#location #Permanent-Addition #outside
- Located on the east side of the house
- Unlocked via the lighting puzzle in [[The Utility Closet - Breaker Box]]
- There is a note that says: There is a minecart in the old tunnels blocking something
	- This is referring to the minecart #underground that can be moved and sometimes blocks access to the [[The Rotating Gear Room]] from [[The Reservoir]] side.
	- See [[Underground Map]]
- Now that this is unlocked, I start with 2 gems each day

	- Here is the last of the equipment for the new mine. I don't think we're gonna need more than this especially if we're gonna limit excavation to 2 stones per day. I was told by the engineer that getting greedier than that might risk the structural integrity of the cave walls, so I suppose we'll have to adhere to his expert opinion, at least for now.  
	- We managed to remove all but one minecart from the old tunnels, two of which were too rusted and worn down to be of any use to us up here, so Dave went ahead and made the call to scrap them. I'm not sure that the foreman is going to be too happy about that but hopefully you can smooth it over.  
	- Now, there is still one more cart down there, but it's locked on a short track and it's way too difficult to move from the reservoir side. It's a little bit awkward because it's blocking the passage, so I suggest someone move it from the other side if they can get over there.  
	- The boss informed us that there are two other ways into the site from that side but I think we're gonna leave that for someone else to finish up if the old man really wants it done.
