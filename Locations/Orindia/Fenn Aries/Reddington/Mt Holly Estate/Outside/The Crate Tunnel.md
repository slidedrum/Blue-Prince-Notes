- After removing a bunch of crates, I got a [[File Cabinet Key]] ^122bd3
	- It is used in the secret room in the 1st floor of the [[The Rotating Gear Room]]
- Once the [[Burning Glass]] is used to light the torches, a floorplan becomes visible
- The floorplan was [[The Tunnel]]
- [[The Foreman]]'s log 621 was also revealed

		- Foreman's log 621
		- 6.18.1918
		- The complete manifest for all of the excavation equipment  has been rigorously checked and delivered to the upper  branch. After tomorrow, the site will be sealed and all  remaining hardware will be packed up and transported to  the original access tunnel for long term storage.  
		- It's unclear if they will also seal that tunnel after our  crew has left but I suspect they may want to keep ready  access to the gear especially now that they have begun  operations in the east mine. A month ago, I believed that  the discovery of [[Gemstone Cave|gemstones in that cavern]] was directly  linked to the closure of this site but now I'm not so  sure. [[Baron Thomas Sinclair|The Baron]] doesn't seem the type to value shiny  baubles over history.
