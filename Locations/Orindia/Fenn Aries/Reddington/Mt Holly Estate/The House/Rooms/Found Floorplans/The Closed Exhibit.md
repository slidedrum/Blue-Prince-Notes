	- Dearest Children,  
	- The pieces are in place and all rigid cogs have been greased. However, if our ambitious plans are to succeed, we must strike ==this== Tuesday. The routine changing of guard personnel on the first of each month means the opportunity we have created for ourselves will likely never be so opportune. If we wait even one additional week, the window will be closed.  
	- On Tuesday, there will be three Royal Guards stationed at Leerson Hall, two of which will be wearing black gloves in lieu of the traditional white. We would be wise to sacrifice almost everything to avoid the white gloved guard, striking only when he takes a recess. The two black gloved guards have been instructed to bind, blind and gag themselves, to spare us the precious extra minutes it would take your group to execute that task on their behalf. However, that also means that once we reach the exhibit, we will truly be on our own.   ^40d195
	- May the Black Shores guide us, may the Black Skies shield us, may our fathers be proud of us,  
	- In arms,  your faithful soldier,  [[Farro|Farro]]
- Based on the heist map in [[The Safehouse - Royal Station]] I can steal the crown by drafting a door behind this room.
