- This room can only be drafted when you have a [[The Schoolhouse]] as an [[Outer Room]]
- There are 8 variants of this room, for grades 1-8. See [[Classrooms]]
- Can also be added permanently via [[The Drafting Studio]] (does this create a [[Grade 9 (Exam)|9th grade]]?)
- When drafting from this room, you can re-roll for every #room/drafting you have, resets for each classroom.
