		- PLEASE PICK UP SOME MORE FRUIT BEFORE FRIDAY AS  WE HAVE JUST BEEN INFORMED  THAT WE MAY HAVE AN EXTRA  GUEST EXPLORING THE HOUSE  NEXT WEEK. FIFTY ! STEPS  SHOULD BE MORE THAN ENOUGH  SO I THINK AN EVEN SPREAD  WOULD BE IDEAL:  
		- FIVE APPLES
		- FIVE BANANAS  
		- FIVE ORANGES  
		- THE ENCLOSED AMOUNT SHOULD  COVER EXPENSES BUT PLEASE  BRING BACK ANT CHANGE FROM  THE ORDER AND LEAVE IT IN THE  PANTRY.
- "A well stocked pantry is always the true test of a large estate, and keeping Mt. Holly's wide gamut of ingredients and supplies stocked has always been one of the primary priorities of the house staff."
