- See [[Grade 2 (Math)|Math classroom]] and [[Grade 7 (Algerbra)]]
- This room has a dartboard puzzle that gives at least one [[special key]].  and usually a normal key
- The colors on the dartboard represent different math operations
	- Blue is Addition
	- Yellow is Subtraction
	- Pink is Multiplication
	- Purple is Division
- Order of operations are inside out
- If the center is a colored square, you multiply ALL numbers of that color by itself before moving on.
- There is also a squiggly sign that can show up, that means round (upward bias).  One squiggle means round to the first digit, 2 means round to the 2nd digit, and so on.
- "This smoky backroom, featuring a pool table and fully stocked bar, has served as a retreat on more than one occasion for guests lacking the social wit required for after-dinner conversation. A rather curious game of darts provided the less competitive players a unique opportunity to ponder over its unusual rules."
