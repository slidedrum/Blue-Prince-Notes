		- Dear Ms. Marigold,  
		- Thank you so much for giving our editors the opportunity to consider your illustrated children's book, '[[The Red Prince]]'. Unfortunately, I regret that we have come to the conclusion that although the illustrations are wonderful, we do not think the material is a good fit with [[Ruffington Red Publishing|Ruffington]]'s current catalogue and therefore will not be pursuing a partnership at this time.  
		- If you provided us with a return envelope, your manuscript will be returned to you. Otherwise, it has been recycled.  
		- Thank you again for thinking of us here at [[Ruffington Red Publishing|Ruffington]], and do not be discouraged to submit any work you complete in the future. We wish you every success in finding a home for your book.
