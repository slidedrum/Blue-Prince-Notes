- This room allows you to craft different items
- Guaranteed item spawn on the desk, will be either:
	- [[Broken Lever]]
	- [[Battery Pack]]
		- Unless you have both, then it could be something else.  I've seen:
			- [[Sledgehammer]]
- #TODO: list all craftable items and what they do
	- [[Lockpick Kit]] + [[Metal Detector]] = [[Pick Sound Amplifier]]
	- [[Magnifying glass]] + [[Metal Detector]] = [[Burning Glass]]
	- [[Sledgehammer]] + [[Battery Pack]] + [[Broken Lever]] = [[Power Hammer]]
	- [[Shovel]] + [[Battery Pack]] + [[Broken Lever]]: [[Jack Hammer]]
	- [[Brass Compass]] + [[Battery Pack]] = [[Powered Electromagnet]]
	- [[Lucky Rabbit's foot]] + [[Coin Purse]] = [[Lucky Purse]]
	- [[Shovel]] + [[Metal Detector]] = [[Detector Shovel]]
	- [[Shovel]] + [[Brass Compass]] = [[Dowsing Rod]]
- Contains page 8 of the [[Song Lyrics]] puzzle
- You could find new crafting recipes by digging up [[Dirt Piles]] with a [[Shovel]] (New means not crafted yet, can get dupes)
- There is a diagram showing the dimensions of the [[The Parlor]] room puzzle boxes
	- ![[Pasted image 20251219125051.png]]
		- The true box does not always contain the prize.
- "Springs, screws and coils scattered atop the workbench show signs of this room's frequent use. A craftsman's studio dedicated to creativity and invention, this room was used by your uncle regularly whenever he needed to fix (or improve) a gadget or contraption."
