		- My obsession with ciphers was renewed after my brother died, for among his journals, I found a curious square: a grid of words, written in a hand I immediately recognized - my mother's. Accompanying this discovery were numerous pages containing traces of my brother's fruitless attempts over the years to decipher this grid.  
		- It was a bittersweet find. The excitement I felt was tempered by memories of the unique bond my mother and brother had always shared. I was the child with an interest in puzzles and wordplay, yet it was Simon to whom she bequeathed this cryptic gift.

		- With all respect to my late brother, it  became clear after spending time poring  over his notes that he was not very  suited to this challenge. Occasionally,  he stumbled upon some promising ideas,  but none of them were thoroughly pursued.  
		- Where I will give him credit, however, is  in the extensive research he conducted,  combing through a career's worth of our  mother's notes and correspondence. This  search culminated in the discovery of a  letter my mother had written a local  professor, requesting "additional  material for use in the creation of a  cryptograph." This meager clue was, according to his survey, the only shred  of evidence in her belongings that  mentioned this project.

		- As for me, I am ashamed to admit that  despite all my boasting, I have nothing to show for nearly three decades of effort. I am no closer to  solving this than I was in those early months of daily obsession. And with  each passing year, I fear my chances of reaching a satisfying conclusion to this adventure grow ever slimmer.  
		- Some might say this outcome is quite fitting - poetic justice for tormenting my readers for so many years with seemingly impossible bafflers. While I can certainly relate to their frustrations, I wonder if we really need to obtain answers to all of life's questions. Must we always quench our thirst for knowledge?

		- At my age, I often find myself looking back at the long path behind me, and I think I am content to leave a few  stones unturned. A life without some mystery is a life without imagination. So, I will lay down this burden and leave this stone, and the winding path of intrigue it precedes, for future  generations to explore.
