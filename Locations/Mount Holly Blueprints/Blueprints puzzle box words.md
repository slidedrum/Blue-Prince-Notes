- In each of the rooms in the [[The Mount Holly Blueprints]], there is a [[Mora Jai Puzzle Boxes]], inside in a word.  Those words spell out:

| Through | Lantern | Light  | In     | Sketches |
| ------- | ------- | ------ | ------ | -------- |
| Cast    | A       | Tint   | Of     | Truth    |
| To      | Find    | Our    | Path   | A        |
| Hue     | Of      | Wisdom | To     | Turn     |
| Us      | Right   | A      | Shade  | Of       |
| Rain    | To      | Pass   | The    | Light    |
| Through | Lantern | Light  | In     | Shadows  |
| Past    | We      | Seek   | What's | Left     |
| Of      | The     | Lies   | We     | Cast     |
