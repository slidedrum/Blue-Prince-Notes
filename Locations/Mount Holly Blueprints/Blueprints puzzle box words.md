- In each of the rooms in the [[The Mount Holly Blueprints]], there is a [[Mora Jai Puzzle Boxes]], inside in a word.  Those words spell out:

| Through | Lantern | Light  | In     | Sketches     |
| ------- | ------- | ------ | ------ | ------------ |
| Cast    | A       | Tint   | Of     | Truth (Blue) |
| To      | Find    | Our    | Path   | A            |
| Hue     | Of      | Wisdom | To     | Turn         |
| Us      | Right   | A      | Shade  | Of           |
| Rain    | To      | Pass   | The    | Light        |
| Through | Lantern | Light  | In     | Shadows      |
| Past    | We      | Seek   | What's | Left         |
| Of      | The     | Lies   | We     | Cast         |
Through lantern light In sketches cast. 
A tint of truth to find our path.
A hue of wisdom to turn us right.
A shade of rain to pass the light.
Through lantern light in shadows past.
We seek what's left of the lies we cast.

- "Tint of truth" likely means Blue, for Mt Holly.
- "hue of wisdom" likely refers to [[Corarica]] because it is academic, so it's orange like [[Hallway]].  Says to turn "right"
- "Shade of rain" likely refers to [[Eraja]]  because it is rainy, so it is violet like [[Bedroom]].  "pass" the light
- "Shadows past" likely refers to [[Orinda Aries]].  However, there are no black rooms.  So maybe it's referring to [[Fenn Aries]] instead, so red?  "Left" of the lies we cast.

Red - Left
Orange - Right
Purple - straight
