 - Located Outside the [[House]] as far as you can go to the east
 - The gate is locked with a 4 digit numerical code. The code is "1128" unclear what the date means, possible wedding day? since it's carved onto a tree with a heart.  First date?
 - Once unlocked it is one of the [[Permanent Additions]], it gives +20 [[steps]] at the start of each day
 - The gate might be one of the [[8 Safes]]
 - There is a cut down tree right outside the gate
	 - There is a photo of the tree before it was cut down in the [[The Darkroom]]

- The knob inside the pen, turns on one of the [[4 Blue Fires]]
- There is a very old looking and run down shack in the corner. Inside the shack is the [[Gardener's Logbook]]
- Next to the book, is some smashed pots, and a gem holder on the floor.  Did someone break it?  Who?   ^fa245d

- There is a sun dial.  It doesn't seem to work. Is it stuck at 1:30? ![[Pasted image 20251213053749.png]] ^6a1dc1
	- After solving the [[Sign and Book puzzle]] in [[A New Clue]] it tells me to "Turn scorched sundial base"
	- Once scorching the base with a [[Burning Glass]] I can rotate it
	- Once rotated it unlocks the [[The Satellite Dish]]
- There are 3 smudge pots keeping the trees warm for the winter![[Pasted image 20251213053810.png]]
- There is a birdbath matching others around the estate.  Probably not relevant? ![[Pasted image 20251213053912.png]]
