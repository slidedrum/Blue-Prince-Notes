- When the hovel is drafted, special rooms cost [[steps]] instead of [[Gems]]
- Contains one of the knobs to turn on one of the [[4 Blue Fires]]
- Has a hint for some puzzle?

	- 45 rooms
	- [[The Antechamber|antechamber]] sealed
	- 2 wings
	- 9 ranks
	- 2 starting rooms.
	- Coincidence?
	- Where is [[Room 46]]???
	- 7/5/90 - Tested my full house theory.  No luck.  As expected.
	- 45 2 9 2
	- Equation is 45\*2/9-2 = 8
	- This is probably somehow related to [[Numeric Coring]]

		- NOTICE OF TERMINATION  
		- Dear [[Denny Revane|Mr. Revane]], 
		- Your half-hearted dedication and maintenance of the grounds have been greatly appreciated. However, I regret to inform you that your services as the groundskeeper at [[House|Mount Holly]] will no longer be required, effective immediately.  
		- This decision has been made after careful consideration and is based upon repeated observations and documented instances of neglect in the performance of your duties. The state of the [[Green Room|green rooms]] in particular has deteriorated significantly over the last few months, which reflects poorly on the rest of the staff.  
		- You are required to vacate the hovel by the 20th of March, ensuring all tools and equipment belonging to the estate are returned to [[The Toolshed]] in good condition. Your final wages will be settled promptly upon completion of these instructions.  
		- We thank you for your time and service and wish you the best in your future endeavors,  
		- [[Mrs Anne Babbage|Anne Babbage]], House Manager
		- mentions: [[The Toolshed]] 
- "A squalid dwelling on the edge of the estate belonging to one of the groundskeepers."
