		- closing address  
		- For the last 38 years, it has been my pleasure of serving as your schoolmaster in this humble little facility. And meager as it may look by modern standards, I think most of us who spent our afternoons here will readily admit that we are reluct to see this small piece of [[Reddington]] history go.  
		- I first wish to thank [[Lady Clara Epsen|Lady Epsen]], our most gracious host today, for not only paying attention in my classes those many years ago - but for all the fundraising she has done on behalf of our community and our children. Without her, [[Reddington Elementary School|Reddington Elementary]] would still be a distant and blurry vision. A vision that I dared not even dream.  
		- That dreamer is of course, the incomparable [[Mrs Peterson|Mrs. Peterson]], our future principal and my reluctant successor who I might add, forced me to give this speech, so I think I'll end my praise of her there, though she deserves much more I'll admit.  
		- To the architect of our new school, the [[Baron Herbert.S. Sinclair|Baron Sinclair]], thank you for following in your father's footsteps in building [[Reddington]] yet another school. And for also allowing the use of your own private residence and floorplans to serve as our interim facility until the new campus is completed in March. A decision, I'm certain he will immediately regret tomorrow morning when he hears the children running through his halls.

		- And lastly, I wish to thank all my students, many of you here today whom I have not seen in years, whose faces I still remember as young and manners wild. Those here whose parents before them I have also taught and whose children I may yet. Without you, I would have had a lifetime of quiet peace. And yet what is all the peace in the world if you have no one to bestow demerits upon.  
		- Thank you all sincerely, my time here has meant the world to me and if I am still standing in eight months, I will see you all at the slightly less melancholic ribbon-cutting ceremony next year.  
		- better joke to end?  
		- remember to give [[Mrs Peterson|Mrs. Peterson]] her gift

		- in [[The Bunk Room]] [[Baron Herbert.S. Sinclair]] is referred to as "Herbie"
- On the blackboard it faintly says "Within a timely manor"
- "Long before Reddington Elementary was opened, school convened in a single small building. As the student body grew over the years, the need for separate classrooms for each grade arose and the Mt. Holly Schoolhouse was officially closed down."
