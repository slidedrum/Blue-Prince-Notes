 #location #room/blue #classrooms
- I think this class is trying to teach me the names and locations of the 8 realm.  And to associate them with their respective sigils
- But this class only goes over 7 of the 8 realms?  Why?  Am I missing something? #question 
- How am I supposed to discern the connection between realms and shapes from this class? #question 
- I should bring a [[Magnifying glass]] here
- The 7 realms it goes over are:
	- [[Arch Aries]]
	- [[Orinda Aries]]
	- [[Eraja]]
	- [[Nuance]]
	- [[Mora Jai]]
	- [[Verra]]
	- [[Corarica]]

	- On the left hand side we see several things 
		- someone looking through a telescope similar to the one found in [[The Observatory]]
		- someone holding up a paper with the star sign "diamonds minor" and some other stuff I can't make out (yet?) He is also holding a compass (the symbol for drafting rooms)
		- someone looking through a microscope similar to the one found in [[The Lab]]
		- Someone flying a balloon with some metal on it?
		- We see a sundial (maybe related to [[Apple Orchard#^6a1dc1]]?)
	- On the top left, we see "The seeker of signs" it has 7 realms with [[Corarica]] in the center.
	- On the top right, we see "The Devoted Circle"

- ![[Pasted image 20251210091929.png]]
	- This map is called: "[[Orrsphere]] - 3rd era"
	- In the central map the named places are:
		- [[Moraven]]
		- [[Mora Jai]]
		- [[Verra]]
		- [[Corarica]]
		- [[The Great Tress]]
		- [[Ajsei]]
		- [[Seija]]
	- On the top left we have "The North Circle"
		- It depicts the northern face of [[Mora]]
		- In the center is the letter "i"
		- Dotted lines go through the ocean, these lines match others I've seen in other places.  Are they trade routes maybe?
	- On the bottom left we have "The South Key"
		- It depicts the southern face of [[Mora]]
		- In the center we see an infinity symbol
		- On the sides we see the sigils of [[Eraja]] [[Corarica]] [[Verra]] and [[Nuance]] over where they would be from this prospective.
		- We see dotted lines across the oceans similar to the ones in other places, possibly trade routes?
	- On the top right we see "The Spiral of Stars"
		- It depicts our solar system similar to [[Grade 4 (Geography)#^e60974|the outer circle]]
		- There is also a line of stars(?) that matches a note found in [[Her Ladyship's Chamber#^b8e28f]]
	- On the bottom right we see "The Sacred Circle"
		- It depicts some kind of structure that kind of looks like a turtle shell?
		- It has numbers on it, and some of the parts have solid lines, some have dotted lines.
		- It has something to do with angles.
			- Angles 90, 58, 46, and 8 can be seen.
		- I can also see the words "rot" and "tor"
		- I'm fairly confident there is #MoreToExploreHere 
	- On the bottom we see 6 "[[monks]]"  in black robes holding boxes. 
		- The monks are flanking a sun in the center, contrast the one from the [[Grade 4 (Geography)#^e95c26|other map]] this sun is awake.
		- They seem to match either the boxes in [[The Parlor]] or the cursed box from [[The Curse Of BlackBridge]]
		- There are some symbols behind them, I have seen them before, not sure where.  nor do I have any clue what they mean.
	- On the left of the image we see the sigil for [[Corarica]] 5 times, 
		- starting light at the top and getting progressively darker.
		- It ends with a mountain with a flag on top.
		- The mountain seems to have a path on it with different stops.  
		- The stop at the base of the mountain seems to be more important.
	- On the top of the image we see a blindfolded woman
		- She is chained to a bat in **her** right hand, and a bird in **her** left hand.
		- The two animals are above flat top brick pyramids?
		- This whole scene takes place in the clouds.
	- On the right side of the image, we see a large tree flanked by two towers.
		- There are two figures Infront of the towers, the towers are from [[Mora Jai]]
			- Because they match the miniature seen in [[Sanctum Door 6]]
		- There is a path from the tree heading south
		- Along the end of the path are baskets of fruit.
