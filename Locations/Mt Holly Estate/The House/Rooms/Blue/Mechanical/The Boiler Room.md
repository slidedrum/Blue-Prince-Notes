- "A utility room serving as a central hub for controlling the heating and steam power supplied to various rooms of the estate. Steam power is conveyed in the estate through [[Vents|steam ducts]] that run through select rooms. These floorplans must be drafted in an alignment that will facilitate the steam traveling through the house to reach its intended destination."
