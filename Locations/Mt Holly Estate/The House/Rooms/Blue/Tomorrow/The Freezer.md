			- The network servers are finally out of cold storage! Or at  least as many as we could fit into the surrounding walls of  [[The Black Bridge Grotto|the Grotto]] off of the East Drive. The last few days have  been very busy, but I'm glad I was able to take a short  break from gardening to help [[Randolph Moore|Randolph]] install the network.  It was, after all, the least he could do, since it was I who  suggested the final location. We decided that we are going to  store the two unused servers here i Mount Holly's freezer.  They should serve as readily accessible replacements should  any of the primary consoles fail.   ^9db5c8
