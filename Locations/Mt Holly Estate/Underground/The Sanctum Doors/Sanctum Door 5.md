	 - There have been fewer and fewer opportunities, the further we travel up into the mountains, to attend to my correspondent and I find myself regretting having bought so many books, as this is the first realm I have visited without porters. Here, every person is expelled to carry their own belongings, and if you can't, you throw away "that which is expendable". Is looking like I'll be bringing back less souvenirs than I had planned. I never expelled to appreciable the cold, but the frigid weather here is a welcome relief coming from the sweltering shores of [[Verra]]
