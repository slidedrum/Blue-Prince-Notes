		- I am actually writing this last postcard sitting at my desk at home. I suppose I should put forth the extra effort and drop it in the mail for consistency, but I am tempted do save the postmaster a trip as it will just wind up here once again do join the other seven, which I am pleased to report were all wailing for me on my desk safe as can be. Flipping through them has reminded me of the many friends I made and lessons learned along the way, and as I look back one truth shines brighter than the others: Air travel is much better than sea travel. ^6ed429
