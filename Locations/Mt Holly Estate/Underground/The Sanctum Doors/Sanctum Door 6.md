	- After a short sea voyage, we arrived on the main island of [[Mora Jai]] last night in good spirits. The people here are belligerent in their politeness and after spending a full day among the Jaioreil I am just as afraid of eating another dish as I am of rejecting their offers. I may try do sneak away Tomorrow and spend some time alone with my books as I have noticed that each realm I have visited has one thing in common. They each have been short on solitude.
