	- Eight realms in eight months. The objective was simple enough, but in what order? What route? and where do start? Questions like these are the ones I tend to ignore as planning has never been my strong suit. Well then! In the true spirit of adventure, I have departed forsaking both map and plan, and as it happens, the road has taken me south. I seems fitting lo begin the journey by visiting a fragment of the old kingdom, a landmark as black in realm as it is in name, and a story I feel closely connected to.
